up the mountain to almuncle from the old and pleasantly situated village of mayenfeld a footpath winds through green and shady meadows to the foot of the mountains which on this side look down from their stern and lofty heights upon the valley below
the land grows gradually wilder as the path ascends and the climber has not gone far before he begins to inhale the fragrance of the short grass and sturdy mountainplants for the way is steep and leads directly up to the summits above
on a clear sunny morning in june two figures might be seen climbing the narrow mountain path one a tall stronglooking girl the other a child whom she was leading by the hand and whose little checks were so aglow with heat that the crimson color could be seen even through the dark sunburnt skin
and this was hardly to be wondered at for in spite of the hot june sun the child was clothed as if to keep off the bitterest frost
she did not look more than five years old if as much but what her natural figure was like it would have been hard to say for she had apparently two if not three dresses one above the other and over these a thick red woollen shawl wound round about her so that the little body presented a shapeless appearance as with its small feet shod in thick nailed mountainshoes it slowly and laboriously plodded its way up in the heat
the two must have left the valley a good hours walk behind them when they came to the hamlet known as dorfli which is situated halfway up the mountain
here the wayfarers met with greetings from all sides some calling to them from windows some from open doors others from outside for the elder girl was now in her old home
she did not however pause in her walk to respond to her friends welcoming cries and questions but passed on without stopping for a moment until she reached the last of the scattered houses of the hamlet
here a voice called to her from the door wait a moment dete if you are going up higher i will come with you
the girl thus addressed stood still and the child immediately let go her hand and seated herself on the ground
are you tired heidi
asked her companion
no i am hot answered the child
we shall soon get to the top now
you must walk bravely on a little longer and take good long steps and in another hour we shall be there said dete in an encouraging voice
they were now joined by a stout goodnaturedlooking woman who walked on ahead with her old acquaintance the two breaking forth at once into lively conversation about everybody and everything in dorfli and its surroundings while the child wandered behind them
and where are you off to with the child
asked the one who had just joined the party
i suppose it is the child your sister left
yes answered dete
i am taking her up to uncle where she must stay
the child stay up there with almuncle
you must be out of your senses dete
how can you think of such a thing
the old man however will soon send you and your proposal packing off home again
he cannot very well do that seeing that he is her grandfather
he must do something for her
i have had the charge of the child till now and i can tell you barbel i am not going to give up the chance which has just fallen to me of getting a good place for her sake
it is for the grandfather now to do his duty by her
that would be all very well if he were like other people asseverated stout barbel warmly but you know what he is
and what can he do with a child especially with one so young
the child cannot possibly live with him
but where are you thinking of going yourself
to frankfurt where an extra good place awaits me answered dete
the people i am going to were down at the baths last summer and it was part of my duty to attend upon their rooms
they would have liked then to take me away with them but i could not leave
now they are there again and have repeated their offer and i intend to go with them you may make up your mind to that
i am glad i am not the child
exclaimed barbel with a gesture of horrified pity
not a creature knows anything about the old man up there
he will have nothing to do with anybody and never sets his foot inside a church from one years end to another
when he does come down once in a while everybody clears out of the way of him and his big stick
the mere sight of him with his bushy grey eyebrows and his immense beard is alarming enough
he looks like any old heathen or indian and few would care to meet him alone
well and what of that
said dete in a defiant voice he is the grandfather all the same and must look after the child
he is not likely to do her any harm and if he does he will be answerable for it not i
i should very much like to know continued barbel in an inquiring tone of voice what the old man has on his conscience that he looks as he does and lives up there on the mountain like a hermit hardly ever allowing himself to be seen
all kinds of things are said about him
you dete however must certainly have learnt a good deal concerning him from your sisteram i not right
you are right i did but i am not going to repeat what i heard if it should come to his ears i should get into trouble about it
now barbel had for long past been most anxious to ascertain particulars about almuncle as she could not understand why he seemed to feel such hatred towards his fellowcreatures and insisted on living all alone or why people spoke about him half in whispers as if afraid to say anything against him and yet unwilling to take his part
moreover barbel was in ignorance as to why all the people in dorfli called him almuncle for he could not possibly be uncle to everybody living there
as however it was the custom she did like the rest and called the old man uncle
barbel had only lived in dorfli since her marriage which had taken place not long before
previous to that her home had been below in prattigau so that she was not well acquainted with all the events that had ever taken place and with all the people who had ever lived in dorfli and its neighborhood
dete on the contrary had been born in dorfli and had lived there with her mother until the death of the latter the year before and had then gone over to the baths at ragatz and taken service in the large hotel there as chambermaid
on the morning of this day she had come all the way from ragatz with the child a friend having given them a lift in a haycart as far as mayenfeld
barbel was therefore determined not to lose this good opportunity of satisfying her curiosity
she put her arm through detes in a confidential sort of way and said i know i can find out the real truth from you and the meaning of all these tales that are afloat about him
i believe you know the whole story
now do just tell me what is wrong with the old man and if he was always shunned as he is now and was always such a misanthrope
how can i possibly tell you whether he was always the same seeing i am only sixandtwenty and he at least seventy years of age so you can hardly expect me to know much about his youth
if i was sure however that what i tell you would not go the whole round of prattigau i could relate all kinds of things about him my mother came from domleschg and so did he
nonsense dete what do you mean
replied barbel somewhat offended gossip has not reached such a dreadful pitch in prattigau as all that and i am also quite capable of holding my tongue when it is necessary
very well then i will tell youbut just wait a moment said dete in a warning voice and she looked back to make sure that the child was not near enough to hear all she was going to relate but the child was nowhere to be seen and must have turned aside from following her companions some time before while these were too eagerly occupied with their conversation to notice it
dete stood still and looked around her in all directions
the footpath wound a little here and there but could nevertheless be seen along its whole length nearly to dorfli no one however was visible upon it at this moment
i see where she is exclaimed barbel look over there
and she pointed to a spot far away from the footpath
she is climbing up the slope yonder with the goatherd and his goats
i wonder why he is so late today bringing them up
it happens well however for us for he can now see after the child and you can the better tell me your tale
oh as to the looking after remarked dete the boy need not put himself out about that she is not by any means stupid for her five years and knows how to use her eyes
she notices all that is going on as i have often had occasion to remark and this will stand her in good stead some day for the old man has nothing beyond his two goats and his hut
did he ever have more
asked barbel
he
i should think so indeed replied dete with animation he was owner once of one of the largest farms in domleschg
he was the elder of two brothers the younger was a quiet orderly man but nothing would please the other but to play the grand gentleman and go driving about the country and mixing with bad company strangers that nobody knew
he drank and gambled away the whole of his property and when this became known to his mother and father they died one shortly after the other of sorrow
the younger brother who was also reduced to beggary went off in his anger no one knew whither while uncle himself having nothing now left to him but his bad name also disappeared
for some time his whereabouts were unknown then some one found out that he had gone to naples as a soldier after that nothing more was heard of him for twelve or fifteen years
at the end of that time he reappeared in domleschg bringing with him a young child whom he tried to place with some of his kinspeople
every door however was shut in his face for no one wished to have any more to do with him
embittered by this treatment he vowed never to set foot in domleschg again and he then came to dorfli where he continued to live with his little boy
his wife was probably a native of the grisons whom he had met down there and who died soon after their marriage
he could not have been entirely without money for he apprenticed his son tobias to a carpenter
he was a steady lad and kindly received by every one in dorfli
the old man was however still looked upon with suspicion and it was even rumoured that he had been forced to make his escape from naples or it might have gone badly with him for that he had killed a man not in fair fight you understand but in some brawl
we however did not refuse to acknowledge our relationship with him my greatgrandmother on my mothers side having been sister to his grandmother
so we called him uncle and as through my father we are also related to nearly every family in dorfli he became known all over the place as uncle and since he went to live on the mountain side he has gone everywhere by the name of almuncle
and what happened to tobias
asked barbel who was listening with deep interest
wait a moment i am coming to that but i cannot tell you everything at once replied dete
tobias was taught his trade in mels and when he had served his apprenticeship he came back to dorfli and married my sister adelaide
they had always been fond of one another and they got on very well together after they were married
but their happiness did not last long
her husband met with his death only two years after their marriage a beam falling upon him as he was working and killing him on the spot
they carried him home and when adelaide saw the poor disfigured body of her husband she was so overcome with horror and grief that she fell into a fever from which she never recovered
she had always been rather delicate and subject to curious attacks during which no one knew whether she was awake or sleeping
and so two months after tobias had been carried to the grave his wife followed him
their sad fate was the talk of everybody far and near and both in private and public the general opinion was expressed that it was a punishment which uncle had deserved for the godless life he had led
some went so far even as to tell him so to his face
our minister endeavored to awaken his conscience and exhorted him to repentance but the old man grew only more wrathful and obdurate and would not speak to a soul and every one did their best to keep out of his way
all at once we heard that he had gone to live up the alm and did not intend ever to come down again and since then he has led his solitary life on the mountain side at enmity with god and man
mother and i took adelaides little one then only a year old into our care
when mother died last year and i went down to the baths to earn some money i paid old ursel who lives in the village just above to keep and look after the child
i stayed on at the baths through the winter for as i could sew and knit i had no difficulty in finding plenty of work and early in the spring the same family i had waited on before returned from frankfurt and again asked me to go back with them
and so we leave the day after tomorrow and i can assure you it is an excellent place for me
and you are going to give the child over to the old man up there
it surprises me beyond words that you can think of doing such a thing dete said barbel in a voice full of reproach
what do you mean
retorted dete
i have done my duty by the child and what would you have me do with it now
i cannot certainly take a child of five years old with me to frankfurt
but where are you going to yourself barbel we are now half way up the alm
we have just reached the place i wanted answered barbel
i had something to say to the goatherds wife who does some spinning for me in the winter
so goodbye dete and good luck to you
dete shook hands with her friend and remained standing while barbel went towards a small dark brown hut which stood a few steps away from the path in a hollow that afforded it some protection from the mountain wind
the hut was situated half way up the alm reckoning from dorfli and it was well that it was provided with some shelter for it was so brokendown and dilapidated that even then it must have been very unsafe as a habitation for when the stormy south wind came sweeping over the mountain everything inside it doors and windows shook and rattled and all the rotten old beams creaked and trembled
on such days as this had the goatherds dwelling been standing above on the exposed mountain side it could not have escaped being blown straight down into the valley without a moments warning
here lived peter the elevenyearold boy who every morning went down to dorfli to fetch his goats and drive them up on to the mountain where they were free to browse till evening on the delicious mountain plants
then peter with his lightfooted animals would go running and leaping down the mountain again till he reached dorfli and there he would give a shrill whistle through his fingers whereupon all the owners of the goats would come out to fetch home the animals that belonged to them
it was generally the small boys and girls who ran in answer to peters whistle for they were none of them afraid of the gentle goats and this was the only hour of the day through all the summer months that peter had any opportunity of seeing his young friends since the rest of his time was spent alone with the goats
he had a mother and a blind grandmother at home it is true but he was always obliged to start off very early in the morning and only got home late in the evening from dorfli for he always stayed as long as he could talking and playing with the other children and so he had just time enough at home and that was all to swallow down his bread and milk in the morning and again in the evening to get through a similar meal lie down in bed and go to sleep
his father who had been known also as the goatherd having earned his living as such when younger had been accidentally killed while cutting wood some years before
his mother whose real name was brigitta was always called the goatherds wife for the sake of old association while the blind grandmother was just grandmother to all the old and young in the neighborhood
dete had been standing for a good ten minutes looking about her in every direction for some sign of the children and the goats
not a glimpse of them however was to be seen so she climbed to a higher spot whence she could get a fuller view of the mountain as it sloped beneath her to the valley while with everincreasing anxiety on her face and in her movements she continued to scan the surrounding slopes
meanwhile the children were climbing up by a far and roundabout way for peter knew many spots where all kinds of good food in the shape of shrubs and plants grew for his goats and he was in the habit of leading his flock aside from the beaten track
the child exhausted with the heat and weight of her thick armor of clothes panted and struggled after him at first with some difficulty
she said nothing but her little eyes kept watching first peter as he sprang nimbly hither and thither on his bare feet clad only in his short light breeches and then the slimlegged goats that went leaping over rocks and shrubs and up the steep ascents with even greater ease
all at once she sat herself down on the ground and as fast as her little fingers could move began pulling off her shoes and stockings
this done she rose unwound the hot red shawl and threw it away and then proceeded to undo her frock
it was off in a second but there was still another to unfasten for dete had put the sunday frock on over the everyday one to save the trouble of carrying it
quick as lightning the everyday frock followed the other and now the child stood up clad only in her light shortsleeved under garment stretching out her little bare arms with glee
she put all her clothes together in a tidy little heap and then went jumping and climbing up after peter and the goats as nimbly as any one of the party
peter had taken no heed of what the child was about when she stayed behind but when she ran up to him in her new attire his face broke into a grin which grew broader still as he looked back and saw the small heap of clothes lying on the ground until his mouth stretched almost from ear to ear he said nothing however
the child able now to move at her ease began to enter into conversation with peter who had many questions to answer for his companion wanted to know how many goats he had where he was going to with them and what he had to do when he arrived there
at last after some time they and the goats approached the hut and came within view of cousin dete
hardly had the latter caught sight of the little company climbing up towards her when she shrieked out heidi what have you been doing
what a sight you have made of yourself
and where are your two frocks and the red wrapper
and the new shoes i bought and the new stockings i knitted for youeverything gone
not a thing left
what can you have been thinking of heidi where are all your clothes
the child quietly pointed to a spot below on the mountain side and answered down there
dete followed the direction of her finger she could just distinguish something lying on the ground with a spot of red on the top of it which she had no doubt was the woollen wrapper
you goodfornothing little thing
exclaimed dete angrily what could have put it into your head to do like that
what made you undress yourself
what do you mean by it
i dont want any clothes said the child not showing any sign of repentance for her past deed
you wretched thoughtless child
have you no sense in you at all
continued dete scolding and lamenting
who is going all that way down to fetch them its a good halfhours walk
peter you go off and fetch them for me as quickly as you can and dont stand there gaping at me as if you were rooted to the ground
i am already past my time answered peter slowly without moving from the spot where he had been standing with his hands in his pockets listening to detes outburst of dismay and anger
well you wont get far if you only keep on standing there with your eyes staring out of your head was detes cross reply but see you shall have something nice and she held out a bright new piece of money to him that sparkled in the sun
peter was immediately up and off down the steep mountain side taking the shortest cut and in an incredibly short space of time had reached the little heap of clothes which he gathered up under his arm and was back again so quickly that even dete was obliged to give him a word of praise as she handed him the promised money
peter promptly thrust it into his pocket and his face beamed with delight for it was not often that he was the happy possessor of such riches
you can carry the things up for me as far as uncles as you are going the same way went on dete who was preparing to continue her climb up the mountain side which rose in a steep ascent immediately behind the goatherds hut
peter willingly undertook to do this and followed after her on his bare feet with his left arm round the bundle and the right swinging his goatherds stick while heidi and the goats went skipping and jumping joyfully beside him
after a climb of more than threequarters of an hour they reached the top of the alm mountain
uncles hut stood on a projection of the rock exposed indeed to the winds but where every ray of sun could rest upon it and a full view could be had of the valley beneath
behind the hut stood three old fir trees with long thick unlopped branches
beyond these rose a further wall of mountain the lower heights still overgrown with beautiful grass and plants above which were stonier slopes covered only with scrub that led gradually up to the steep bare rocky summits
against the hut on the side looking towards the valley uncle had put up a seat
here he was sitting his pipe in his mouth and his hands on his knees quietly looking out when the children the goats and cousin dete suddenly clambered into view
heidi was at the top first
she went straight up to the old man put out her hand and said goodevening grandfather
so so what is the meaning of this
he asked gruffly as he gave the child an abrupt shake of the hand and gazed long and scrutinisingly at her from under his bushy eyebrows
heidi stared steadily back at him in return with unflinching gaze for the grandfather with his long beard and thick grey eyebrows that grew together over his nose and looked just like a bush was such a remarkable appearance that heidi was unable to take her eyes off him
meanwhile dete had come up with peter after her and the latter now stood still a while to watch what was going on
i wish you goodday uncle said dete as she walked towards him and i have brought you tobias and adelaides child
you will hardly recognise her as you have never seen her since she was a year old
and what has the child to do with me up here
asked the old man curtly
you there he then called out to peter be off with your goats you are none too early as it is and take mine with you
peter obeyed on the instant and quickly disappeared for the old man had given him a look that made him feel that he did not want to stay any longer
the child is here to remain with you dete made answer
i have i think done my duty by her for these four years and now it is time for you to do yours
thats it is it
said the old man as he looked at her with a flash in his eye
and when the child begins to fret and whine after you as is the way with these unreasonable little beings what am i to do with her then
thats your affair retorted dete
i know i had to put up with her without complaint when she was left on my hands as an infant and with enough to do as it was for my mother and self
now i have to go and look after my own earnings and you are the next of kin to the child
if you cannot arrange to keep her do with her as you like
you will be answerable for the result if harm happens to her though you have hardly need i should think to add to the burden already on your conscience
now dete was not quite easy in her own conscience about what she was doing and consequently was feeling hot and irritable and said more than she had intended
as she uttered her last words uncle rose from his seat
he looked at her in a way that made her draw back a step or two then flinging out his arm he said to her in a commanding voice be off with you this instant and get back as quickly as you can to the place whence you came and do not let me see your face again in a hurry
dete did not wait to be told twice
goodbye to you then and to you too heidi she called as she turned quickly away and started to descend the mountain at a running pace which she did not slacken till she found herself safely again at dorfli for some inward agitation drove her forwards as if a steamengine was at work inside her
again questions came raining down upon her from all sides for every one knew dete as well as all particulars of the birth and former history of the child and all wondered what she had done with it
from every door and window came voices calling where is the child
where have you left the child dete
and more and more reluctantly dete made answer up there with almuncle
with almuncle have i not told you so already
then the women began to hurl reproaches at her first one cried out how could you do such a thing
then another to think of leaving a helpless little thing up therewhile again and again came the words the poor mite
the poor mite
pursuing her as she went along
unable at last to bear it any longer dete ran forward as fast as she could until she was beyond reach of their voices
she was far from happy at the thought of what she had done for the child had been left in her care by her dying mother
she quieted herself however with the idea that she would be better able to do something for the child if she was earning plenty of money and it was a relief to her to think that she would soon be far away from all these people who were making such a fuss about the matter and she rejoiced further still that she was at liberty now to take such a good place
at home with grandfather as soon as dete had disappeared the old man went back to his bench and there he remained seated staring on the ground without uttering a sound while thick curls of smoke floated upward from his pipe
heidi meanwhile was enjoying herself in her new surroundings she looked about till she found a shed built against the hut where the goats were kept she peeped in and saw it was empty
she continued her search and presently came to the fir trees behind the hut
a strong breeze was blowing through them and there was a rushing and roaring in their topmost branches heidi stood still and listened
the sound growing fainter she went on again to the farther corner of the hut and so round to where her grandfather was sitting
seeing that he was in exactly the same position as when she left him she went and placed herself in front of the old man and putting her hands behind her back stood and gazed at him
her grandfather looked up and as she continued standing there without moving what is it you want
he asked
i want to see what you have inside the house said heidi
come then
and the grandfather rose and went before her towards the hut
bring your bundle of clothes in with you he bid her as she was following
i shant want them any more was her prompt answer
the old man turned and looked searchingly at the child whose dark eyes were sparkling in delighted anticipation of what she was going to see inside
she is certainly not wanting in intelligence he murmured to himself
and why shall you not want them any more
he asked aloud
because i want to go about like the goats with their thin light legs
well you can do so if you like said her grandfather but bring the things in we must put them in the cupboard
heidi did as she was told
the old man now opened the door and heidi stepped inside after him she found herself in a good sized room which covered the whole ground floor of the hut
a table and a chair were the only furniture in one corner stood the grandfathers bed in another was the hearth with a large kettle hanging above it and on the further side was a large door in the wallthis was the cupboard
the grandfather opened it inside were his clothes some hanging up others a couple of shirts and some socks and handkerchiefs lying on a shelf on a second shelf were some plates and cups and glasses and on a higher one still a round loaf smoked meat and cheese for everything that almuncle needed for his food and clothing was kept in this cupboard
heidi as soon as it was opened ran quickly forward and thrust in her bundle of clothes as far back behind her grandfathers things as possible so that they might not easily be found again
she then looked carefully round the room and asked where am i to sleep grandfather
wherever you like he answered
heidi was delighted and began at once to examine all the nooks and corners to find out where it would be pleasantest to sleep
in the corner near her grandfathers bed she saw a short ladder against the wall up she climbed and found herself in the hayloft
there lay a large heap of fresh sweetsmelling hay while through a round window in the wall she could see right down the valley
i shall sleep up here grandfather she called down to him its lovely up here
come up and see how lovely it is
oh i know all about it he called up in answer
i am getting the bed ready now she called down again as she went busily to and fro at her work but i shall want you to bring me up a sheet you cant have a bed without a sheet you want it to lie upon
all right said the grandfather and presently he went to the cupboard and after rummaging about inside for a few minutes he drew out a long coarse piece of stuff which was all he had to do duty for a sheet
he carried it up to the loft where he found heidi had already made quite a nice bed
she had put an extra heap of hay at one end for a pillow and had so arranged it that when in bed she would be able to see comfortably out through the round window
that is capital said her grandfather now we must put on the sheet but wait a moment first and he went and fetched another large bundle of hay to make the bed thicker so that the child should not feel the hard floor under herthere now bring it here
heidi had got hold of the sheet but it was almost too heavy for her to carry this was a good thing however as the close thick stuff would prevent the sharp stalks of the hay running through and pricking her
the two together now spread the sheet over the bed and where it was too long or too broad heidi quickly tucked it in under the hay
it looked now as tidy and comfortable a bed as you could wish for and heidi stood gazing thoughtfully at her handiwork
we have forgotten something now grandfather she said after a short silence
whats that
a coverlid when you get into bed you have to creep in between the sheets and the coverlid
oh thats the way is it
but suppose i have not got a coverlid
said the old man
well never mind grandfather said heidi in a consoling tone of voice i can take some more hay to put over me and she was turning quickly to fetch another armful from the heap when her grandfather stopped her
wait a moment he said and he climbed down the ladder again and went towards his bed
he returned to the loft with a large thick sack made of flax which he threw down exclaiming there that is better than hay is it not
heidi began tugging away at the sack with all her little might in her efforts to get it smooth and straight but her small hands were not fitted for so heavy a job
her grandfather came to her assistance and when they had got it tidily spread over the bed it all looked so nice and warm and comfortable that heidi stood gazing at it in delight
that is a splendid coverlid she said and the bed looks lovely altogether
i wish it was night so that i might get inside it at once
i think we might have something to eat first said the grandfather what do you think
heidi in the excitement of bedmaking had forgotten everything else but now when she began to think about food she felt terribly hungry for she had had nothing to eat since the piece of bread and little cup of thin coffee that had been her breakfast early that morning before starting on her long hot journey
so she answered without hesitation yes i think so too
let us go down then as we both think alike said the old man and he followed the child down the ladder
then he went up to the hearth pushed the big kettle aside and drew forward the little one that was hanging on the chain and seating himself on the roundtopped threelegged stool before the fire blew it up into a clear bright flame
the kettle soon began to boil and meanwhile the old man held a large piece of cheese on a long iron fork over the fire turning it round and round till it was toasted a nice golden yellow color on each side
heidi watched all that was going on with eager curiosity
suddenly some new idea seemed to come into her head for she turned and ran to the cupboard and then began going busily backwards and forwards
presently the grandfather got up and came to the table with a jug and the cheese and there he saw it already tidily laid with the round loaf and two plates and two knives each in its right place for heidi had taken exact note that morning of all that there was in the cupboard and she knew which things would be wanted for their meal
ah thats right said the grandfather i am glad to see that you have some ideas of your own and as he spoke he laid the toasted cheese on a layer of bread but there is still something missing
heidi looked at the jug that was steaming away invitingly and ran quickly back to the cupboard
at first she could only see a small bowl left on the shelf but she was not long in perplexity for a moment later she caught sight of two glasses further back and without an instants loss of time she returned with these and the bowl and put them down on the table
good i see you know how to set about things but what will you do for a seat
the grandfather himself was sitting on the only chair in the room
heidi flew to the hearth and dragging the threelegged stool up to the table sat herself down upon it
well you have managed to find a seat for yourself i see only rather a low one i am afraid said the grandfather but you would not be tall enough to reach the table even if you sat in my chair the first thing now however is to have something to eat so come along
with that he stood up filled the bowl with milk and placing it on the chair pushed it in front of heidi on her little three legged stool so that she now had a table to herself
then he brought her a large slice of bread and a piece of the golden cheese and told her to eat
after which he went and sat down on the corner of the table and began his own meal
heidi lifted the bowl with both hands and drank without pause till it was empty for the thirst of all her long hot journey had returned upon her
then she drew a deep breathin the eagerness of her thirst she had not stopped to breatheand put down the bowl
was the milk nice
asked her grandfather
i never drank any so good before answered heidi
then you must have some more and the old man filled her bowl again to the brim and set it before the child who was now hungrily beginning her bread having first spread it with the cheese which after being toasted was soft as butter the two together tasted deliciously and the child looked the picture of content as she sat eating and at intervals taking further draughts of milk
the meal being over the grandfather went outside to put the goatshed in order and heidi watched with interest while he first swept it out and then put fresh straw for the goats to sleep upon
then he went to the little well shed and there he cut some long round sticks and a small round board in this he bored some holes and stuck the sticks into them and there as if made by magic was a threelegged stool just like her grandfathers only higher
heidi stood and looked at it speechless with astonishment
what do you think that is
its my stool i know because it is such a high one and it was made all of a minute said the child still lost in wonder and admiration
she understands what she sees her eyes are in the right place remarked the grandfather to himself as he continued his way round the hut knocking in a nail here and there or making fast some part of the door and so with hammer and nails and pieces of wood going from spot to spot mending or clearing away wherever work of the kind was needed
heidi followed him step by step her eyes attentively taking in all that he did and everything that she saw was a fresh source of pleasure to her
and so the time passed happily on till evening
then the wind began to roar louder than ever through the old fir trees heidi listened with delight to the sound and it filled her heart so full of gladness that she skipped and danced round the old trees as if some unheard of joy had come to her
the grandfather stood and watched her from the shed
suddenly a shrill whistle was heard
heidi paused in her dancing and the grandfather came out
down from the heights above the goats came springing one after another with peter in their midst
heidi sprang forward with a cry of joy and rushed among the flock greeting first one and then another of her old friends of the morning
as they neared the hut the goats stood still and then two of their number two beautiful slender animals one white and one brown ran forward to where the grandfather was standing and began licking his hands for he was holding a little salt which he always had ready for his goats on their return home
peter disappeared with the remainder of his flock
heidi tenderly stroked the two goats in turn running first to one side of them and then the other and jumping about in her glee at the pretty little animals
are they ours grandfather
are they both ours
are you going to put them in the shed
will they always stay with us
heidis questions came tumbling out one after the other so that her grandfather had only time to answer each of them with yes yes
when the goats had finished licking up the salt her grandfather told her to go and fetch her bowl and the bread
heidi obeyed and was soon back again
the grandfather milked the white goat and filled her basin and then breaking off a piece of bread now eat your supper he said and then go up to bed
cousin dete left another little bundle for you with a nightgown and other small things in it which you will find at the bottom of the cupboard if you want them
i must go and shut up the goats so be off and sleep well
goodnight grandfather
goodnight
what are their names grandfather what are their names
she called out as she ran after his retreating figure and the goats
the white one is named little swan and the brown one little bear he answered
goodnight little swan goodnight little bear
she called again at the top of her voice for they were already inside the shed
then she sat down on the seat and began to eat and drink but the wind was so strong that it almost blew her away so she made haste and finished her supper and then went indoors and climbed up to her bed where she was soon lying as sweetly and soundly asleep as any young princess on her couch of silk
not long after and while it was still twilight the grandfather also went to bed for he was up every morning at sunrise and the sun came climbing up over the mountains at a very early hour during these summer months
the wind grew so tempestuous during the night and blew in such gusts against the walls that the hut trembled and the old beams groaned and creaked
it came howling and wailing down the chimney like voices of those in pain and it raged with such fury among the old fir trees that here and there a branch was snapped and fell
in the middle of the night the old man got up
the child will be frightened he murmured half aloud
he mounted the ladder and went and stood by the childs bed
outside the moon was struggling with the dark fastdriving clouds which at one moment left it clear and shining and the next swept over it and all again was dark
just now the moonlight was falling through the round window straight on to heidis bed
she lay under the heavy coverlid her cheeks rosy with sleep her head peacefully resting on her little round arm and with a happy expression on her baby face as if dreaming of something pleasant
the old man stood looking down on the sleeping child until the moon again disappeared behind the clouds and he could see no more then he went back to bed
out with the goats heidi was awakened early the next morning by a loud whistle the sun was shining through the round window and falling in golden rays on her bed and on the large heap of hay and as she opened her eyes everything in the loft seemed gleaming with gold
she looked around her in astonishment and could not imagine for a while where she was
but her grandfathers deep voice was now heard outside and then heidi began to recall all that had happened how she had come away from her former home and was now on the mountain with her grandfather instead of with old ursula
the latter was nearly stone deaf and always felt cold so that she sat all day either by the hearth in the kitchen or by the sittingroom stove and heidi had been obliged to stay close to her for the old woman was so deaf that she could not tell where the child was if out of her sight
and heidi shut up within the four walls had often longed to be out of doors
so she felt very happy this morning as she woke up in her new home and remembered all the many new things that she had seen the day before and which she would see again that day and above all she thought with delight of the two dear goats
heidi jumped quickly out of bed and a very few minutes sufficed her to put on the clothes which she had taken off the night before for there were not many of them
then she climbed down the ladder and ran outside the hut
there stood peter already with his flock of goats and the grandfather was just bringing his two out of the shed to join the others
heidi ran forward to wish goodmorning to him and the goats
do you want to go with them on to the mountain
nothing could have pleased heidi better and she jumped for joy in answer
but you must first wash and make yourself tidy
the sun that shines so brightly overhead will else laugh at you for being dirty see i have put everything ready for you and her grandfather pointed as he spoke to a large tub full of water which stood in the sun before the door
heidi ran to it and began splashing and rubbing till she quite glistened with cleanliness
the grandfather meanwhile went inside the hut calling to peter to follow him and bring in his wallet
peter obeyed with astonishment and laid down the little bag which held his meagre dinner
open it said the old man and inside it he put a large piece of bread and an equally large piece of cheese which made peter open his eyes for each was twice the size of the two portions which he had for his own dinner
there now there is only the little bowl to add continued the grandfather for the child cannot drink her milk as you do from the goat she is not accustomed to that
you must milk two bowlfuls for her when she has her dinner for she is going with you and will remain with you till you return this evening but take care she does not fall over any of the rocks do you hear
heidi now came running in
will the sun laugh at me now grandfather
she asked anxiously
her grandfather had left a coarse towel hanging up for her near the tub and with this she had so thoroughly scrubbed her face arms and neck for fear of the sun that as she stood there she was as red all over as a lobster
he gave a little laugh
no there is nothing for him to laugh at now he assured her
but i tell you whatwhen you come home this evening you will have to get right into the tub like a fish for if you run about like the goats you will get your feet dirty
now you can be off
she started joyfully for the mountain
during the night the wind had blown away all the clouds the dark blue sky was spreading overhead and in its midst was the bright sun shining down on the green slopes of the mountain where the flowers opened their little blue and yellow cups and looked up to him smiling
heidi went running hither and thither and shouting with delight for here were whole patches of delicate red primrss and there the blue gleam of the lovely gentian while above them all laughed and nodded the tenderleaved golden cistus
enchanted with all this waving field of brightlycolored flowers heidi forgot even peter and the goats
she ran on in front and then off to the side tempted first one way and then the other as she caught sight of some bright spot of glowing red or yellow
and all the while she was plucking whole handfuls of the flowers which she put into her little apron for she wanted to take them all home and stick them in the hay so that she might make her bedroom look just like the meadows outside
peter had therefore to be on the alert and his round eyes which did not move very quickly had more work than they could well manage for the goats were as lively as heidi they ran in all directions and peter had to follow whistling and calling and swinging his stick to get all the runaways together again
where have you got to now heidi
he called out somewhat crossly
here called back a voice from somewhere
peter could see no one for heidi was seated on the ground at the foot of a small hill thickly overgrown with sweet smelling prunella the whole air seemed filled with its fragrance and heidi thought she had never smelt anything so delicious
she sat surrounded by the flowers drawing in deep breaths of the scented air
come along here
called peter again
you are not to fall over the rocks your grandfather gave orders that you were not to do so
where are the rocks
asked heidi answering him back
but she did not move from her seat for the scent of the flowers seemed sweeter to her with every breath of wind that wafted it towards her
up above right up above
we have a long way to go yet so come along
and on the topmost peak of all the old bird of prey sits and croaks
that did it
heidi immediately sprang to her feet and ran up to peter with her apron full of flowers
you have got enough now said the boy as they began climbing up again together
you will stay here forever if you go on picking and if you gather all the flowers now there will be none for tomorrow
this last argument seemed a convincing one to heidi and moreover her apron was already so full that there was hardly room for another flower and it would never do to leave nothing to pick for another day
so she now kept with peter and the goats also became more orderly in their behavior for they were beginning to smell the plants they loved that grew on the higher slopes and clambered up now without pause in their anxiety to reach them
the spot where peter generally halted for his goats to pasture and where he took up his quarters for the day lay at the foot of the high rocks which were covered for some distance up by bushes and fir trees beyond which rose their bare and rugged summits
on one side of the mountain the rock was split into deep clefts and the grandfather had reason to warn peter of danger
having climbed as far as the haltingplace peter unslung his wallet and put it carefully in a little hollow of the ground for he knew what the wind was like up there and did not want to see his precious belongings sent rolling down the mountain by a sudden gust
then be threw himself at full length on the warm ground for he was tired after all his exertions
heidi meanwhile had unfastened her apron and rolling it carefully round the flowers laid it beside peters wallet inside the hollow she then sat down beside his outstretched figure and looked about her
the valley lay far below bathed in the morning sun
in front of her rose a broad snowfield high against the darkblue sky while to the left was a huge pile of rocks on either side of which a bare lofty peak that seemed to pierce the blue looked frowningly down upon her
the child sat without moving her eyes taking in the whole scene and all around was a great stillness only broken by soft light puffs of wind that swayed the light bells of the blue flowers and the shining gold heads of the cistus and set them nodding merrily on their slender stems
peter had fallen asleep after his fatigue and the goats were climbing about among the bushes overhead
heidi had never felt so happy in her life before
she drank in the golden sunlight the fresh air the sweet smell of the flowers and wished for nothing better than to remain there forever
so the time went on while to heidi who had so often looked up from the valley at the mountains above these seemed now to have faces and to be looking down at her like old friends
suddenly she heard a loud harsh cry overhead and lifting her eyes she saw a bird larger than any she had ever seen before with great spreading wings wheeling round and round in wide circles and uttering a piercing croaking kind of sound above her
peter peter wake up
called out heidi
see the great bird is therelook look
peter got up on hearing her call and together they sat and watched the bird which rose higher and higher in the blue air till it disappeared behind the grey mountaintops
where has it gone to
asked heidi who had followed the birds movements with intense interest
home to its nest said peter
is his home right up there
oh how nice to be up so high
why does he make that noise
because he cant help it explained peter
let us climb up there and see where his nest is proposed heidi
oh
exclaimed peter his disapproval of heidis suggestion becoming more marked with each ejaculation why even the goats cannot climb as high as that besides didnt uncle say that you were not to fall over the rocks
peter now began suddenly whistling and calling in such a loud manner that heidi could not think what was happening but the goats evidently understood his voice for one after the other they came springing down the rocks until they were all assembled on the green plateau some continuing to nibble at the juicy stems others skipping about here and there or pushing at each other with their horns for pastime
heidi jumped up and ran in and out among them for it was new to her to see the goats playing together like this and her delight was beyond words as she joined in their frolics she made personal acquaintance with them all in turn for they were like separate individuals to her each single goat having a particular way of behavior of its own
meanwhile peter had taken the wallet out of the hollow and placed the pieces of bread and cheese on the ground in the shape of a square the larger two on heidis side and the smaller on his own for he knew exactly which were hers and which his
then he took the little bowl and milked some delicious fresh milk into it from the white goat and afterwards set the bowl in the middle of the square
now he called heidi to come but she wanted more calling than the goats for the child was so excited and amused at the capers and lively games of her new playfellows that she saw and heard nothing else
but peter knew how to make himself heard for he shouted till the very rocks above echoed his voice and at last heidi appeared and when she saw the inviting repast spread out upon the ground she went skipping round it for joy
leave off jumping about it is time for dinner said peter sit down now and begin
heidi sat down
is the milk for me
she asked giving another look of delight at the beautifully arranged square with the bowl as a chief ornament in the centre
yes replied peter and the two large pieces of bread and cheese are yours also and when you have drunk up that milk you are to have another bowlful from the white goat and then it will be my turn
and which do you get your milk from
inquired heidi
from my own goat the piebald one
but go on now with your dinner said peter again reminding her it was time to eat
heidi now took up the bowl and drank her milk and as soon as she had put it down empty peter rose and filled it again for her
then she broke off a piece of her bread and held out the remainder which was still larger than peters own piece together with the whole big slice of cheese to her companion saying you can have that i have plenty
peter looked at heidi unable to speak for astonishment for never in all his life could he have said and done like that with anything he had
he hesitated a moment for he could not believe that heidi was in earnest but the latter kept on holding out the bread and cheese and as peter still did not take it she laid it down on his knees
he saw then that she really meant it he seized the food nodded his thanks and acceptance of her present and then made a more splendid meal than he had known ever since he was a goatherd
heidi the while still continued to watch the goats
tell me all their names she said
peter knew these by heart for having very little else to carry in his head he had no difficulty in remembering them
so he began telling heidi the name of each goat in turn as he pointed it out to her
heidi listened with great attention and it was not long before she could herself distinguish the goats from one another and could call each by name for every goat had its own peculiarities which could not easily be mistaken only one had to watch them closely and this heidi did
there was the great turk with his big horns who was always wanting to butt the others so that most of them ran away when they saw him coming and would have nothing to do with their rough companion
only greenfinch the slender nimble little goat was brave enough to face him and would make a rush at him three or four times in succession with such agility and dexterity that the great turk often stood still quite astounded not venturing to attack her again for greenfinch was fronting him prepared for more warlike action and her horns were sharp
then there was little white snowflake who bleated in such a plaintive and beseeching manner that heidi already had several times run to it and taken its head in her hands to comfort it
just at this moment the pleading young cry was heard again and heidi jumped up running and putting her arms round the little creatures neck asked in a sympathetic voice what is it little snowflake
why do you call like that as if in trouble
the goat pressed closer to heidi in a confiding way and left off bleating
peter called out from where he was sittingfor he had not yet got to the end of his bread and cheese she cries like that because the old goat is not with her she was sold at mayenfeld the day before yesterday and so will not come up the mountain any more
who is the old goat
called heidi back
why her mother of course was the answer
where is the grandmother
called heidi again
she has none
and the grandfather
oh you poor little snowflake
exclaimed heidi clasping the animal gently to her but do not cry like that any more see now i shall come up here with you every day so that you will not be alone any more and if you want anything you have only to come to me
the young animal rubbed its head contentedly against heidis shoulder and no longer gave such plaintive bleats
peter now having finished his meal joined heidi and the goats heidi having by this time found out a great many things about these
she had decided that by far the handsomest and bestbehaved of the goats were undoubtedly the two belonging to her grandfather they carried themselves with a certain air of distinction and generally went their own way and as to the great turk they treated him with indifference and contempt
the goats were now beginning to climb the rocks again each seeking for the plants it liked in its own fashion some jumping over everything they met till they found what they wanted others going more carefully and cropping all the nice leaves by the way the turk still now and then giving the others a poke with his horns
little swan and little bear clambered lightly up and never failed to find the best bushes and then they would stand gracefully poised on their pretty legs delicately nibbling at the leaves
heidi stood with her hands behind her back carefully noting all they did
peter she said to the boy who had again thrown himself down on the ground the prettiest of all the goats are little swan and little bear
yes i know they are was the answer
almuncle brushes them down and washes them and gives them salt and he has the nicest shed for them
all of a sudden peter leaped to his feet and ran hastily after the goats
heidi followed him as fast as she could for she was too eager to know what had happened to stay behind
peter dashed through the middle of the flock towards that side of the mountain where the rocks fell perpendicularly to a great depth below and where any thoughtless goat if it went too near might fall over and break all its legs
he had caught sight of the inquisitive greenfinch taking leaps in that direction and he was only just in time for the animal had already sprung to the edge of the abyss
all peter could do was to throw himself down and seize one of her hind legs
greenfinch thus taken by surprise began bleating furiously angry at being held so fast and prevented from continuing her voyage of discovery
she struggled to get loose and endeavored so obstinately to leap forward that peter shouted to heidi to come and help him for he could not get up and was afraid of pulling out the goats leg altogether
heidi had already run up and she saw at once the danger both peter and the animal were in
she quickly gathered a bunch of sweetsmelling leaves and then holding them under greenfinchs nose said coaxingly come come greenfinch you must not be naughty
look you might fall down there and break your leg and that would give you dreadful pain
the young animal turned quickly and began contentedly eating the leaves out of heidis hand
meanwhile peter got on to his feet again and took hold of greenfinch by the band round her neck from which her bell was hung and heidi taking hold of her in the same way on the other side they led the wanderer back to the rest of the flock that had remained peacefully feeding
peter now he had his goat in safety lifted his stick in order to give her a good beating as punishment and greenfinch seeing what was coming shrank back in fear
but heidi cried out no no peter you must not strike her see how frightened she is
she deserves it growled peter and again lifted his stick
then heidi flung herself against him and cried indignantly you have no right to touch her it will hurt her let her alone
peter looked with surprise at the commanding little figure whose dark eyes were flashing and reluctantly he let his stick drop
well i will let her off if you will give me some more of your cheese tomorrow he said for he was determined to have something to make up to him for his fright
you shall have it all tomorrow and every day i do not want it replied heidi giving ready consent to his demand
and i will give you bread as well a large piece like you had today but then you must promise never to beat greenfinch or snowflake or any of the goats
all right said peter i dont care which meant that he would agree to the bargain
he now let go of greenfinch who joyfully sprang to join her companions
and thus imperceptibly the day had crept on to its close and now the sun was on the point of sinking out of sight behind the high mountains
heidi was again sitting on the ground silently gazing at the blue bellshaped flowers as they glistened in the evening sun for a golden light lay on the grass and flowers and the rocks above were beginning to shine and glow
all at once she sprang to her feet peter
peter
everything is on fire
all the rocks are burning and the great snow mountain and the sky
o look look
the high rock up there is red with flame
o the beautiful fiery snow
stand up peter
see the fire has reached the great birds nest
look at the rocks
look at the fir trees
everything everything is on fire
it is always like that said peter composedly continuing to peel his stick but it is not really fire
what is it then
cried heidi as she ran backwards and forwards to look first one side and then the other for she felt she could not have enough of such a beautiful sight
what is it peter what is it
she repeated
it gets like that of itself explained peter
look look
cried heidi in fresh excitement now they have turned all rose color
look at that one covered with snow and that with the high pointed rocks
what do you call them
mountains have not any names he answered
o how beautiful look at the crimson snow
and up there on the rocks there are ever so many roses
now they are turning grey
now all the color has died away
its all gone peter
and heidi sat down on the ground looking as full of distress as if everything had really come to an end
it will come again tomorrow said peter
get up we must go home now
he whistled to his goats and together they all started on their homeward way
is it like that every day shall we see it every day when we bring the goats up here
asked heidi as she clambered down the mountain at peters side she waited eagerly for his answer hoping that he would tell her it was so
it is like that most days he replied
but will it be like that tomorrow for certain
heidi persisted
yes yes tomorrow for certain peter assured her in answer
heidi now felt quite happy again and her little brain was so full of new impressions and new thoughts that she did not speak any more until they had reached the hut
the grandfather was sitting under the fir trees where he had also put up a seat waiting as usual for his goats which returned down the mountain on this side
heidi ran up to him followed by the white and brown goats for they knew their own master and stall
peter called out after her come with me again tomorrow
for he was anxious for more than one reason that heidi should go with him the next day
heidi ran back quickly and gave peter her hand promising to go with him and then making her way through the goats she once more clasped snowflake round the neck saying in a gentle soothing voice sleep well snowflake and remember that i shall be with you again tomorrow so you must not bleat so sadly any more
snowflake gave her a friendly and grateful look and then went leaping joyfully after the other goats
heidi returned to the firtrees
o grandfather she cried even before she had come up to him it was so beautiful
the fire and the roses on the rocks and the blue and yellow flowers and look what i have brought you
and opening the apron that held her flowers she shook them all out at her grandfathers feet
but the poor flowers how changed they were
heidi hardly knew them again
they looked like dry bits of hay not a single little flower cup stood open
o grandfather what is the matter with them
exclaimed heidi in shocked surprise they were not like that this morning why do they look so now
they like to stand out there in the sun and not to be shut up in an apron said her grandfather
then i will never gather any more
but grandfather why did the great bird go on croaking so
she continued in an eager tone of inquiry
go along now and get into your bath while i go and get some milk when we are together at supper i will tell you all about it
heidi obeyed and when later she was sitting on her high stool before her milk bowl with her grandfather beside her she repeated her question why does the great bird go on croaking and screaming down at us grandfather
he is mocking at the people who live down below in the villages because they all go huddling and gossiping together and encourage one another in evil talking and deeds
he calls out if you would separate and each go your own way and come up here and live on a height as i do it would be better for you
there was almost a wildness in the old mans voice as he spoke so that heidi seemed to hear the croaking of the bird again even more distinctly
why havent the mountains any names
heidi went on
they have names answered her grandfather and if you can describe one of them to me that i know i will tell you what it is called
heidi then described to him the rocky mountain with the two high peaks so exactly that the grandfather was delighted
just so i know it and he told her its name
did you see any other
then heidi told him of the mountain with the great snowfield and how it had been on fire and had turned rosyred and then all of a sudden had grown quite pale again and all the color had disappeared
i know that one too he said giving her its name
so you enjoyed being out with the goats
then heidi went on to give him an account of the whole day and of how delightful it had all been and particularly described the fire that had burst out everywhere in the evening
and then nothing would do but her grandfather must tell how it came for peter knew nothing about it
the grandfather explained to her that it was the sun that did it
when he says goodnight to the mountains he throws his most beautiful colors over them so that they may not forget him before he comes again the next day
heidi was delighted with this explanation and could hardly bear to wait for another day to come that she might once more climb up with the goats and see how the sun bid goodnight to the mountains
but she had to go to bed first and all night she slept soundly on her bed of hay dreaming of nothing but of shining mountains with red roses all over them among which happy little snowflake went leaping in and out
the visit to grandmother the next morning the sun came out early as bright as ever and then peter appeared with the goats and again the two children climbed up together to the high meadows and so it went on day after day till heidi passing her life thus among the grass and flowers was burnt brown with the sun and grew so strong and healthy that nothing ever ailed her
she was happy too and lived from day to day as free and lighthearted as the little birds that make their home among the green forest trees
then the autumn came and the wind blew louder and stronger and the grandfather would say sometimes today you must stay at home heidi a sudden gust of the wind would blow a little thing like you over the rocks into the valley below in a moment
whenever peter heard that he must go alone he looked very unhappy for he saw nothing but mishaps of all kinds ahead and did not know how he should bear the long dull day without heidi
then too there was the good meal he would miss and besides that the goats on these days were so naughty and obstinate that he had twice the usual trouble with them for they had grown so accustomed to heidis presence that they would run in every direction and refuse to go on unless she was with them
heidi was never unhappy for wherever she was she found something to interest or amuse her
she liked best it is true to go out with peter up to the flowers and the great bird where there was so much to be seen and so many experiences to go through among the goats with their different characters but she also found her grandfathers hammering and sawing and carpentering very entertaining and if it should chance to be the day when the large round goatsmilk cheese was made she enjoyed beyond measure looking on at this wonderful performance and watching her grandfather as with sleeves rolled back he stirred the great cauldron with his bare arms
the thing which attracted her most however was the waving and roaring of the three old fir trees on these windy days
she would run away repeatedly from whatever she might be doing to listen to them for nothing seemed so strange and wonderful to her as the deep mysterious sound in the tops of the trees
she would stand underneath them and look up unable to tear herself away looking and listening while they bowed and swayed and roared as the mighty wind rushed through them
there was no longer now the warm bright sun that had shone all through the summer so heidi went to the cupboard and got out her shoes and stockings and dress for it was growing colder every day and when heidi stood under the fir trees the wind blew through her as if she was a thin little leaf but still she felt she could not stay indoors when she heard the branches waving outside
then it grew very cold and peter would come up early in the morning blowing on his fingers to keep them warm
but he soon left off coming for one night there was a heavy fall of snow and the next morning the whole mountain was covered with it and not a single little green leaf was to be seen anywhere upon it
there was no peter that day and heidi stood at the little window looking out in wonderment for the snow was beginning again and the thick flakes kept falling till the snow was up to the window and still they continued to fall and the snow grew higher so that at last the window could not be opened and she and her grandfather were shut up fast within the hut
heidi thought this was great fun and ran from one window to the other to see what would happen next and whether the snow was going to cover up the whole hut so that they would have to light a lamp although it was broad daylight
but things did not get as bad as that and the next day the snow having ceased the grandfather went out and shovelled away the snow round the house and threw it into such great heaps that they looked like mountains standing at intervals on either side the hut
and now the windows and door could be opened and it was well it was so for as heidi and her grandfather were sitting one afternoon on their threelegged stools before the fire there came a great thump at the door followed by several others and then the door opened
it was peter who had made all that noise knocking the snow off his shoes he was still white all over with it for he had had to fight his way through deep snowdrifts and large lumps of snow that had frozen upon him still clung to his clothes
he had been determined however not to be beaten and to climb up to the hut for it was a week now since he had seen heidi
goodevening he said as he came in then he went and placed himself as near the fire as he could without saying another word but his whole face was beaming with pleasure at finding himself there
heidi looked on in astonishment for peter was beginning to thaw all over with the warmth so that he had the appearance of a trickling waterfall
well general and how goes it with you
said the grandfather now that you have lost your army you will have to turn to your pen and pencil
why must he turn to his pen and pencil
asked heidi immediately full of curiosity
during the winter he must go to school explained her grandfather and learn how to read and write its a bit hard although useful sometimes afterwards
am i not right general
yes indeed assented peter
heidis interest was now thoroughly awakened and she had so many questions to put to peter about all that was to be done and seen and heard at school and the conversation took so long that peter had time to get thoroughly dry
peter had always great difficulty in putting his thoughts into words and he found his share of the talk doubly difficult today for by the time he had an answer ready to one of heidis questions she had already put two or three more to him and generally such as required a whole long sentence in reply
the grandfather sat without speaking during this conversation only now and then a twitch of amusement at the corners of his mouth showed that he was listening
well now general you have been under fire for some time and must want some refreshment come and join us he said at last and as he spoke he rose and went to fetch the supper out of the cupboard and heidi pushed the stools to the table
there was also now a bench fastened against the wall for as he was no longer alone the grandfather had put up seats of various kinds here and there long enough to hold two persons for heidi had a way of always keeping close to her grandfather whether he was walking sitting or standing
so there was comfortable place for them all three and peter opened his round eyes very wide when he saw what a large piece of meat almuncle gave him on his thick slice of bread
it was a long time since peter had had anything so nice to eat
as soon as the pleasant meal was over peter began to get ready for returning home for it was already growing dark
he had said his goodnight and his thanks and was just going out when he turned again and said i shall come again next sunday this day week and grandmother sent word that she would like you to come and see her one day
it was quite a new idea to heidi that she should go and pay anybody a visit and she could not get it out of her head so the first thing she said to her grandfather the next day was i must go down to see the grandmother today she will be expecting me
the snow is too deep answered the grandfather trying to put her off
but heidi had made up her mind to go since the grandmother had sent her that message
she stuck to her intention and not a day passed but what in the course of it she said five or six times to her grandfather i must certainly go today the grandmother will be waiting for me
on the fourth day when with every step one took the ground crackled with frost and the whole vast field of snow was hard as ice heidi was sitting on her high stool at dinner with the bright sun shining in upon her through the window and again repeated her little speech i must certainly go down to see the grandmother today or else i shall keep her waiting too long
the grandfather rose from table climbed up to the hayloft and brought down the thick sack that was heidis coverlid and said come along then
the child skipped out gleefully after him into the glittering world of snow
the old fir trees were standing now quite silent their branches covered with the white snow and they looked so lovely as they glittered and sparkled in the sunlight that heidi jumped for joy at the sight and kept on calling out come here come here grandfather
the fir trees are all silver and gold
the grandfather had gone into the shed and he now came out dragging a large handsleigh along with him inside it was a low seat and the sleigh could be pushed forward and guided by the feet of the one who sat upon it with the help of a pole that was fastened to the side
after he had been taken round the fir trees by heidi that he might see their beauty from all sides he got into the sleigh and lifted the child on to his lap then he wrapped her up in the sack that she might keep nice and warm and put his left arm closely round her for it was necessary to hold her tight during the coming journey
he now grasped the pole with his right hand and gave the sleigh a push forward with his two feet
the sleigh shot down the mountain side with such rapidity that heidi thought they were flying through the air like a bird and shouted aloud with delight
suddenly they came to a standstill and there they were at peters hut
her grandfather lifted her out and unwrapped her
there you are now go in and when it begins to grow dark you must start on your way home again
then he left her and went up the mountain pulling his sleigh after him
heidi opened the door of the hut and stepped into a tiny room that looked very dark with a fireplace and a few dishes on a wooden shelf this was the little kitchen
she opened another door and now found herself in another small room for the place was not a herdsmans hut like her grandfathers with one large room on the ground floor and a hayloft above but a very old cottage where everything was narrow and poor and shabby
a table was close to the door and as heidi stepped in she saw a woman sitting at it putting a patch on a waistcoat which heidi recognised at once as peters
in the corner sat an old woman bent with age spinning
heidi was quite sure this was the grandmother so she went up to the spinningwheel and said good day grandmother i have come at last did you think i was a long time coming
the woman raised her head and felt for the hand that the child held out to her and when she found it she passed her own over it thoughtfully for a few seconds and then said are you the child who lives up with almuncle are you heidi
yes yes answered heidi i have just come down in the sleigh with grandfather
is it possible
why your hands are quite warm
brigitta did alm uncle come himself with the child
peters mother had left her work and risen from the table and now stood looking at heidi with curiosity scanning her from head to foot
i do not know mother whether uncle came himself it is hardly likely the child probably makes a mistake
but heidi looked steadily at the woman not at all as if in any uncertainty and said i know quite well who wrapped me in my bedcover and brought me down in the sleigh it was grandfather
there was some truth then perhaps in what peter used to tell us of almuncle during the summer when we thought he must be wrong said grandmother but who would ever have believed that such a thing was possible
i did not think the child would live three weeks up there
what is she like brigitta
the latter had so thoroughly examined heidi on all sides that she was well able to describe her to her mother
she has adelaides slenderness of figure but her eyes are dark and her hair curly like her fathers and the old mans up there she takes after both of them i think
heidi meanwhile had not been idle she had made the round of the room and looked carefully at everything there was to be seen
all of a sudden she exclaimed grandmother one of your shutters is flapping backwards and forwards grandfather would put a nail in and make it all right in a minute or else it will break one of the panes some day look look how it keeps on banging
ah dear child said the old woman i am not able to see it but i can hear that and many other things besides the shutter
everything about the place rattles and creaks when the wind is blowing and it gets inside through all the cracks and holes
the house is going to pieces and in the night when the two others are asleep i often lie awake in fear and trembling thinking that the whole place will give way and fall and kill us
and there is not a creature to mend anything for us for peter does not understand such work
but why cannot you see grandmother that the shutter is loose
look there it goes again see that one there
and heidi pointed to the particular shutter
alas child it is not only that i cannot seei can see nothing nothing said the grandmother in a voice of lamentation
but if i were to go outside and put back the shutter so that you had more light then you could see grandmother
no no not even then no one can make it light for me again
but if you were to go outside among all the white snow then surely you would find it light just come with me grandmother and i will show you
heidi took hold of the old womans hand to lead her along for she was beginning to feel quite distressed at the thought of her being without light
let me be dear child it is always dark for me now whether in snow or sun no light can penetrate my eyes
but surely it does in summer grandmother said heidi more and more anxious to find some way out of the trouble when the hot sun is shining down again and he says goodnight to the mountains and they all turn on fire and the yellow flowers shine like gold then you will see it will be bright and beautiful for you again
ah child i shall see the mountains on fire or the yellow flowers no more it will never be light for me again on earth never
at these words heidi broke into loud crying
in her distress she kept on sobbing out who can make it light for you again
can no one do it
isnt there any one who can do it
the grandmother now tried to comfort the child but it was not easy to quiet her
heidi did not often weep but when she did she could not get over her trouble for a long while
the grandmother had tried all means in her power to allay the childs grief for it went to her heart to hear her sobbing so bitterly
at last she said come here dear heidi come and let me tell you something
you cannot think how glad one is to hear a kind word when one can no longer see and it is such a pleasure to me to listen to you while you talk
so come and sit beside me and tell me something tell me what you do up there and how grandfather occupies himself
i knew him very well in old days but for many years now i have heard nothing of him except through peter who never says much
this was a new and happy idea to heidi she quickly dried her tears and said in a comforting voice wait grandmother till i have told grandfather everything he will make it light for you again i am sure and will do something so that the house will not fall he will put everything right for you
the grandmother was silent and heidi now began to give her a lively description of her life with the grandfather and of the days she spent on the mountain with the goats and then went on to tell her of what she did now during the winter and how her grandfather was able to make all sorts of things seats and stools and mangers where the hay was put for little swan and little bear besides a new large watertub for her to bathe in when the summer came and a new milkbowl and spoon and heidi grew more and more animated as she enumerated all the beautiful things which were made so magically out of pieces of wood she then told the grandmother how she stood by him and watched all he did and how she hoped some day to be able to make the same herself
the grandmother listened with the greatest attention only from time to time addressing her daughter do you hear that brigitta
do you hear what she is saying about uncle
the conversation was all at once interrupted by a heavy thump on the door and in marched peter who stood stockstill opening his eyes with astonishment when he caught sight of heidi then his face beamed with smiles as she called out goodevening peter
what is the boy back from school already
exclaimed the grandmother in surprise
i have not known an afternoon pass so quickly as this one for years
how is the reading getting on peter
just the same was peters answer
the old woman gave a little sigh
ah well she said i hoped you would have something different to tell me by this time as you are going to be twelve years old this february
what was it that you hoped he would have to tell you
asked heidi interested in all the grandmother said
i mean that he ought to have learnt to read a bit by now continued the grandmother
up there on the shelf is an old prayerbook with beautiful songs in it which i have not heard for a long time and cannot now remember to repeat to myself and i hoped that peter would soon learn enough to be able to read one of them to me sometimes but he finds it too difficult
i must get a light it is getting too dark to see said peters mother who was still busy mending his waistcoat
i feel too as if the afternoon had gone i hardly know how
heidi now jumped up from her low chair and holding out her hand hastily to the grandmother said goodnight grandmother if it is getting dark i must go home at once and bidding goodbye to peter and his mother she went towards the door
but the grandmother called out in an anxious voice wait wait heidi you must not go alone like that peter must go with you and take care of the child peter that she does not fall and dont let her stand still for fear she should get frozen do you hear
has she got anything warm to put around her throat
i have not anything to put on called back heidi but i am sure i shall not be cold and with that she ran outside and went off at such a pace that peter had difficulty in overtaking her
the grandmother still in distress called out to her daughter run after her brigitta the child will be frozen to death on such a night as this take my shawl run quickly
brigitta ran out
but the children had taken but a few steps before they saw the grandfather coming down to meet them and in another minute his long strides had brought him to their side
thats right heidi you have kept your word said the grandfather and then wrapping the sack firmly round her he lifted her in his arms and strode off with her up the mountain
brigitta was just in time to see him do all this and on her return to the hut with peter expressed her astonishment to the grandmother
the latter was equally surprised and kept on saying god be thanked that he is good to the child god be thanked
will he let her come to me again i wonder
the child has done me so much good
what a loving little heart it is and how merrily she tells her tale
and she continued to dwell with delight on the thought of the child until she went to bed still saying now and again if only she will come again
now i have really something left in the world to take pleasure in
and brigitta agreed with all her mother said and peter nodded his head in approval each time his grandmother spoke saying with a broad smile of satisfaction i told you so
meanwhile heidi was chattering away to her grandfather from inside her sack her voice however could not reach him through the many thick folds of her wrap and as therefore it was impossible to understand a word she was saying he called to her wait till we get home and then you can tell me all about it
they had no sooner got inside the hut than heidi having been released from her covering at once began what she had to say grandfather tomorrow we must take the hammer and the long nails and fasten grandmothers shutter and drive in a lot more nails in other places for her house shakes and rattles all over
we must must we
who told you that
nobody told me but i know it for all that replied heidi for everything is giving way and when the grandmother cannot sleep she lies trembling for fear at the noise for she thinks that every minute the house will fall down on their heads and everything now is dark for grandmother and she does not think any one can make it light for her again but you will be able to i am sure grandfather
think how dreadful it is for her to be always in the dark and then to be frightened at what may happen and nobody can help her but you
tomorrow we must go and help her we will wont we grandfather
the child was clinging to the old man and looking up at him in trustful confidence
the grandfather looked down at heidi for a while without speaking and then said yes heidi we will do something to stop the rattling at least we can do that we will go down about it tomorrow
the child went skipping round the room for joy crying out we shall go tomorrow
we shall go tomorrow
the grandfather kept his promise
on the following afternoon he brought the sleigh out again and as on the previous day he set heidi down at the door of the grandmothers hut and said go in now and when it grows dark come out again
then he put the sack in the sleigh and went round the house
heidi had hardly opened the door and sprung into the room when the grandmother called out from her corner its the child again
here she comes
and in her delight she let the thread drop from her fingers and the wheel stood still as she stretched out both her hands in welcome
heidi ran to her and then quickly drew the little stool close up to the old woman and seating herself upon it began to tell and ask her all kinds of things
all at once came the sound of heavy blows against the wall of the hut and the grandmother gave such a start of alarm that she nearly upset the spinningwheel and cried in a trembling voice ah my god now it is coming the house is going to fall upon us
but heidi caught her by the arm and said soothingly no no grandmother do not be frightened it is only grandfather with his hammer he is mending up everything so that you shant have such fear and trouble
is it really possible
so the dear god has not forgotten us
exclaimed the grandmother
do you hear brigitta what that noise is
did you hear what the child says
now as i listen i can tell it is a hammer go outside brigitta and if it is almuncle tell him he must come inside a moment that i may thank him
brigitta went outside and found almuncle in the act of fastening some heavy pieces of new wood along the wall
she stepped up to him and said goodevening uncle mother and i have to thank you for doing us such a kind service and she would like to tell you herself how grateful she is i do not know who else would have done it for us we shall not forget your kindness for i am sure that will do said the old man interrupting her
i know what you think of almuncle without your telling me
go indoors again i can find out for myself where the mending is wanted
brigitta obeyed on the spot for uncle had a way with him that made few people care to oppose his will
he went on knocking with his hammer all round the house and then mounted the narrow steps to the roof and hammered away there until he had used up all the nails he had brought with him
meanwhile it had been growing dark and he had hardly come down from the roof and dragged the sleigh out from behind the goatshed when heidi appeared outside
the grandfather wrapped her up and took her in his arms as he had done the day before for although he had to drag the sleigh up the mountain after him he feared that if the child sat in it alone her wrappings would fall off and that she would be nearly if not quite frozen so he carried her warm and safe in his arms
so the winter went by
after many years of joyless life the blind grandmother had at last found something to make her happy her days were no longer passed in weariness and darkness one like the other without pleasure or change for now she had always something to which she could look forward
she listened for the little tripping footstep as soon as day had come and when she heard the door open and knew the child was really there she would call out god be thanked she has come again
and heidi would sit by her and talk and tell her everything she knew in so lively a manner that the grandmother never noticed how the time went by and never now as formerly asked brigitta isnt the day done yet
but as the child shut the door behind her on leaving would exclaim how short the afternoon has seemed dont you think so brigitta
and this one would answer i do indeed it seems as if i had only just cleared away the midday meal
and the grandmother would continue pray god the child is not taken from me and that almuncle continues to let her come
does she look well and strong brigitta
and the latter would answer she looks as bright and rosy as an apple
and heidi had also grown very fond of the old grandmother and when at last she knew for certain that no one could make it light for her again she was overcome with sorrow but the grandmother told her again that she felt the darkness much less when heidi was with her and so every fine winters day the child came travelling down in her sleigh
the grandfather always took her never raising any objection indeed he always carried the hammer and sundry other things down in the sleigh with him and many an afternoon was spent by him in making the goatherds cottage sound and tight
it no longer groaned and rattled the whole night through and the grandmother who for many winters had not been able to sleep in peace as she did now said she should never forget what the uncle had done for her
two visits and what came of them quickly the winter passed and still more quickly the bright glad summer and now another winter was drawing to its close
heidi was still as lighthearted and happy as the birds and looked forward with more delight each day to the coming spring when the warm south wind would roar through the fir trees and blow away the snow and the warm sun would entice the blue and yellow flowers to show their heads and the long days out on the mountain would come again which seemed to heidi the greatest joy that the earth could give
heidi was now in her eighth year she had learnt all kinds of useful things from her grandfather she knew how to look after the goats as well as any one and little swan and bear would follow her like two faithful dogs and give a loud bleat of pleasure when they heard her voice
twice during the course of this last winter peter had brought up a message from the schoolmaster at dorfli who sent word to alm uncle that he ought to send heidi to school as she was over the usual age and ought indeed to have gone the winter before
uncle had sent word back each time that the schoolmaster would find him at home if he had anything he wished to say to him but that he did not intend to send heidi to school and peter had faithfully delivered his message
when the march sun had melted the snow on the mountain side and the snowdrops were peeping out all over the valley and the fir trees had shaken off their burden of snow and were again merrily waving their branches in the air heidi ran backwards and forwards with delight first to the goatshed then to the fir trees and then to the hutdoor in order to let her grandfather know how much larger a piece of green there was under the trees and then would run off to look again for she could hardly wait till everything was green and the full beautiful summer had clothed the mountain with grass and flowers
as heidi was thus running about one sunny march morning and had just jumped over the watertrough for the tenth time at least she nearly fell backwards into it with fright for there in front of her looking gravely at her stood an old gentleman dressed in black
when he saw how startled she was he said in a kind voice dont be afraid of me for i am very fond of children
shake hands
you must be the heidi i have heard of where is your grandfather
he is sitting by the table making round wooden spoons heidi informed him as she opened the door
he was the old village pastor from dorfli who had been a neighbor of uncles when he lived down there and had known him well
he stepped inside the hut and going up to the old man who was bending over his work said goodmorning neighbor
the grandfather looked up in surprise and then rising said goodmorning in return
he pushed his chair towards the visitor as he continued if you do not mind a wooden seat there is one for you
the pastor sat down
it is a long time since i have seen you neighbor he said
or i you was the answer
i have come today to talk over something with you continued the pastor
i think you know already what it is that has brought me here and as he spoke he looked towards the child who was standing at the door gazing with interest and surprise at the stranger
heidi go off to the goats said her grandfather
you take them a little salt and stay with them till i come
heidi vanished on the spot
the child ought to have been at school a year ago and most certainly this last winter said the pastor
the schoolmaster sent you word about it but you gave him no answer
what are you thinking of doing with the child neighbor
i am thinking of not sending her to school was the answer
the visitor surprised looked across at the old man who was sitting on his bench with his arms crossed and a determined expression about his whole person
how are you going to let her grow up then
i am going to let her grow up and be happy among the goats and birds with them she is safe and will learn nothing evil
but the child is not a goat or a bird she is a human being
if she learns no evil from these comrdes of hers she will at the same time learn nothing but she ought not to grow up in ignorance and it is time she began her lessons
i have come now that you may have leisure to think over it and to arrange about it during the summer
this is the last winter that she must be allowed to run wild next winter she must come regularly to school every day
she will do no such thing said the old man with calm determination
do you mean that by no persuasion can you be brought to see reason and that you intend to stick obstinately to your decision
said the pastor growing somewhat angry
you have been about the world and must have seen and learnt much and i should have given you credit for more sense neighbor
indeed replied the old man and there was a tone in his voice that betrayed a growing irritation on his part too and does the worthy pastor really mean that he would wish me next winter to send a young child like that some miles down the mountain on icecold mornings through storm and snow and let her return at night when the wind is raging when even one like ourselves would run a risk of being blown down by it and buried in the snow
and perhaps he may not have forgotten the childs mother adelaide
she was a sleepwalker and had fits
might not the child be attacked in the same way if obliged to overexert herself
and some one thinks they can come and force me to send her
i will go before all the courts of justice in the country and then we shall see who will force me to do it
you are quite right neighbor said the pastor in a friendly tone of voice
i see it would have been impossible to send the child to school from here
but i perceive that the child is dear to you for her sake do what you ought to have done long ago come down into dorfli and live again among your fellowmen
what sort of a life is this you lead alone and with bitter thoughts towards god and man
if anything were to happen to you up here who would there be to help you
i cannot think but what you must be halffrozen to death in this hut in the winter and i do not know how the child lives through it
the child has young blood in her veins and a good roof over her head and let me further tell the pastor that i know where wood is to be found and when is the proper time to fetch it the pastor can go and look inside my woodshed the fire is never out in my hut the whole winter through
as to going to live below that is far from my thoughts the people despise me and i them it is therefore best for all of us that we live apart
no no it is not best for you i know what it is you lack said the pastor in an earnest voice
as to the people down there looking on you with dislike it is not as bad as you think
believe me neighbor seek to make your peace with god pray for forgiveness where you need it and then come and see how differently people will look upon you and how happy you may yet be
the pastor had risen and stood holding out his hand to the old man as he added with renewed earnestness i will wager neighbor that next winter you will be down among us again and we shall be good neighbors as of old
i should be very grieved if any pressure had to be put upon you give me your hand and promise me that you will come and live with us again and become reconciled to god and man
almuncle gave the pastor his hand and answered him calmly and firmly you mean well by me i know but as to that which you wish me to do i say now what i shall continue to say that i will not send the child to school nor come and live among you
then god help you
said the pastor and he turned sadly away and left the hut and went down the mountain
almuncle was out of humor
when heidi said as usual that afternoon can we go down to grandmother now
he answered not today
he did not speak again the whole of that day and the following morning when heidi again asked the same question he replied we will see
but before the dinner bowls had been cleared away another visitor arrived and this time it was cousin dete
she had a fine feathered hat on her head and a long trailing skirt to her dress which swept the floor and on the floor of a goatherds hut there are all sorts of things that do not belong to a dress
the grandfather looked her up and down without uttering a word
but dete was prepared with an exceedingly amiable speech and began at once to praise the looks of the child
she was looking so well she should hardly have known her again and it was evident that she had been happy and wellcared for with her grandfather but she had never lost sight of the idea of taking the child back again for she well understood that the little one must be much in his way but she had not been able to do it at first
day and night however she had thought over the means of placing the child somewhere and that was why she had come to day for she had just heard of something that would be a lucky chance for heidi beyond her most ambitious hopes
some immensely wealthy relatives of the people she was serving who had the most splendid house almost in frankfurt had an only daughter young and an invalid who was always obliged to go about in a wheeled chair she was therefore very much alone and had no one to share her lessons and so the little girl felt dull
her father had spoken to detes mistress about finding a companion for her and her mistress was anxious to help in the matter as she felt so sympathetic about it
the ladyhousekeeper had described the sort of child they wanted simpleminded and unspoilt and not like most of the children that one saw nowa days
dete had thought at once of heidi and had gone off without delay to see the ladyhousekeeper and after dete had given her a description of heidi she had immediately agreed to take her
and no one could tell what good fortune there might not be in store for heidi for if she was once with these people and they took a fancy to her and anything happened to their own daughterone could never tell the child was so weaklyand they did not feel they could live without a child why then the most unheard of luck have you nearly finished what you had to say
broke in alm uncle who had allowed her to talk on uninterruptedly so far
ugh
exclaimed dete throwing up her head in disgust one would think i had been talking to you about the most ordinary matter why there is not one person in all prattigau who would not thank god if i were to bring them such a piece of news as i am bringing you
you may take your news to anybody you like i will have nothing to do with it
but now dete leaped up from her seat like a rocket and cried if that is all you have to say about it why then i will give you a bit of my mind
the child is now eight years old and knows nothing and you will not let her learn
you will not send her to church or school as i was told down in dorfli and she is my own sisters child
i am responsible for what happens to her and when there is such a good opening for a child as this which offers for heidi only a person who cares for nobody and never wishes good to any one would think of not jumping at it
but i am not going to give in and that i tell you i have everybody in dorfli on my side there is not one person there who will not take my part against you and i advise you to think well before bringing it into court if that is your intention there are certain things which might be brought up against you which you would not care to hear for when one has to do with lawcourts there is a great deal raked up that had been forgotten
be silent
thundered the uncle and his eyes flashed with anger
go and be done with you
and never let me see you again with your hat and feather and such words on your tongue as you come with today
and with that he strode out of the hut
you have made grandfather angry said heidi and her dark eyes had anything but a friendly expression in them as she looked at dete
he will soon be all right again come now said dete hurriedly and show me where your clothes are
i am not coming said heidi
nonsense continued dete then altering her tone to one half coaxing halfcross come come you do not understand any better than your grandfather you will have all sorts of good things that you never dreamed of
then she went to the cupboard and taking out heidis things rolled them up in a bundle
come along now theres your hat it is very shabby but will do for the present put it on and let us make haste off
i am not coming repeated heidi
dont be so stupid and obstinate like a goat i suppose its from the goats you have learnt to be so
listen to me you saw your grandfather was angry and heard what he said that he did not wish to see us ever again he wants you now to go away with me and you must not make him angrier still
you cant think how nice it is at frankfurt and what a lot of things you will see and if you do not like it you can come back again your grandfather will be in a good temper again by that time
can i return at once and be back home again here this evening
asked heidi
what are you talking about come along now
i tell you that you can come back here when you like
today we shall go as far as mayenfeld and early tomorrow we shall start in the train and that will bring you home again in no time when you wish it for it goes as fast as the wind
dete had now got the bundle under her arm and the child by the hand and so they went down the mountain together
as it was still too early in the year to take his goats out peter continued to go to school at dorfli but now and again he stole a holiday for he could see no use in learning to read while to wander about a bit and look for stout sticks which might be wanted some day he thought a far better employment
as dete and heidi neared the grandmothers hut they met peter coming round the corner he had evidently been well rewarded that day for his labors for he was carrying an immense bundle of long thick hazel sticks on his shoulders
he stood still and stared at the two approaching figures as they came up to him he exclaimed where are you going heidi
i am only just going over to frankfurt for a little visit with dete she replied but i must first run in to grandmother she will be expecting me
no no you must not stop to talk it is already too late said dete holding heidi who was struggling to get away fast by the hand
you can go in when you come back you must come along now and she pulled the child on with her fearing that if she let her go in heidi might take it into her head again that she did not wish to come and that the grandmother might stand by her
peter ran into the hut and banged against the table with his bundle of sticks with such violence that everything in the room shook and his grandmother leaped up with a cry of alarm from her spinningwheel
peter had felt that he must give vent to his feelings somehow
what is the matter
cried the frightened old woman while his mother who had also started up from her seat at the shock said in her usual patient manner what is it peter
why do you behave so roughly
because she is taking heidi away explained peter
who
where to peter where to
asked the grandmother growing still more agitated but even as she spoke she guessed what had happened for brigitta had told her shortly before that she had seen dete going up to almuncle
the old woman rose hastily and with trembling hands opened the window and called out beseechingly dete dete do not take the child away from us
do not take her away
the two who were hastening down the mountain heard her voice and dete evidently caught the words for she grasped heidis hand more firmly
heidi struggled to get free crying grandmother is calling i must go to her
but dete had no intention of letting the child go and quieted her as best she could they must make haste now she said or they would be too late and not able to go on the next day to frankfurt and there the child would see how delightful it was and dete was sure would not wish to go back when she was once there
but if heidi wanted to return home she could do so at once and then she could take something she liked back to grandmother
this was a new idea to heidi and it pleased her so much that dete had no longer any difficulty in getting her along
after a few minutes silence heidi asked what could i take back to her
we must think of something nice answered dete a soft roll of white bread she would enjoy that for now she is old she can hardly eat the hard black bread
no she always gives it back to peter telling him it is too hard for i have seen her do it myself affirmed heidi
do let us make haste for then perhaps we can get back soon from frankfurt and i shall be able to give her the white bread to day
and heidi started off running so fast that dete with the bundle under her arm could scarcely keep up with her
but she was glad nevertheless to get along so quickly for they were nearing dorfli where her friends would probably talk and question in a way that might put other ideas into heidis head
so she went on straight ahead through the village holding heidi tightly by the hand so that they might all see that it was on the childs account she was hurrying along at such a rate
to all their questions and remarks she made answer as she passed i cant stop now as you see i must make haste with the child as we have yet some way to go
are you taking her away
is she running away from almuncle
its a wonder she is still alive
but what rosy cheeks she has
such were the words which rang out on all sides and dete was thankful that she had not to stop and give any distinct answers to them while heidi hurried eagerly forward without saying a word
from that day forward almuncle looked fiercer and more forbidding than ever when he came down and passed through dorfli
he spoke to no one and looked such an ogre as he came along with his pack of cheeses on his back his immense stick in his hand and his thick frowning eyebrows that the women would call to their little ones take care
get out of almuncles way or he may hurt you
the old man took no notice of anybody as he strode through the village on his way to the valley below where he sold his cheeses and bought what bread and meat he wanted for himself
after he had passed the villagers all crowded together looking after him and each had something to say about him how much wilder he looked than usual how now he would not even respond to anybodys greeting while they all agreed that it was a great mercy the child had got away from him and had they not all noticed how the child had hurried along as if afraid that her grandfather might be following to take her back
only the blind grandmother would have nothing to say against him and told those who came to her to bring her work or take away what she had spun how kind and thoughtful he had been with the child how good to her and her daughter and how many afternoons he had spent mending the house which but for his help would certainly by this time have fallen down over their heads
and all this was repeated down in dorfli but most of the people who heard it said that grandmother was too old to understand and very likely had not heard rightly what was said as she was blind she was probably also deaf
almuncle went no more now to the grandmothers house and it was well that he had made it so safe for it was not touched again for a long time
the days were sad again now for the old blind woman and not one passed but what she would murmur complainingly alas
all our happiness and pleasure have gone with the child and now the days are so long and dreary
pray god i see heidi again once more before i die
just now she was in what was known as the study where to judge by the various things standing and lying about which added to the cosy appearance of the room the family was fond of sitting
a handsome bookcase with glass doors explained why it was called the study and here evidently the little girl was accustomed to have her lessons
claras little face was thin and pale and at this moment her two soft blue eyes were fixed on the clock which seemed to her to go very slowly this day and with a slight accent of impatience which was very rare with her she asked isnt it time yet fraulein rottenmeier
this lady was sitting very upright at a small worktable busy with her embroidery
she had on a mysteriouslooking loose garment a large collar or shouldercape that gave a certain solemnity to her appearance which was enhanced by a very lofty domeshaped head dress
for many years past since the mistress of the house had died the housekeeping and the superintendence of the servants had been entrusted by herr sesemann to fraulein rottenmeier
he himself was often away from home and he left her in sole charge with the condition only that his little daughter should have a voice in all matters and that nothing should be done against her wish
as clara was putting her impatient question for the second time dete and heidi arrived at the front door and the former inquired of the coachman who had just got down from his box if it was too late to see fraulein rottenmeier
thats not my business grumbled the coachman ring the bell in the hall for sebastian
dete did so and sebastian came downstairs he looked astonished when he saw her opening his eyes till they were nearly as big as the large round buttons on his coat
is it too late for me to see fraulein rottenmeier
dete asked again
thats not my business answered the man ring that other bell for the maid tinette and without troubling himself any farther sebastian disappeared
dete rang again
this time tinette appeared with a spotless white cap perched on the top of her head and a mocking expression of face
what is it
she called from the top of the stairs
dete repeated her question
tinette disappeared but soon came back and called down again to dete come up she is expecting you
dete and heidi went upstairs and into the study tinette following
dete remained standing politely near the door still holding heidi tightly by the hand for she did not know what the child might take it into her head to do amid these new surroundings
fraulein rottenmeier rose slowly and went up to the little new companion for the daughter of the house to see what she was like
she did not seem very pleased with her appearance
heidi was dressed in her plain little woollen frock and her hat was an old straw one bent out of shape
the child looked innocently out from beneath it gazing with unconcealed astonishment at the ladys towering head dress
what is your name
asked fraulein rottenmeier after scrutinisingly examining the child for some minutes while heidi in return kept her eyes steadily fixed upon the lady
heidi she answered in a clear ringing voice
what
thats no christian name for a child you were not christened that
what name did they give you when you were baptized
continued fraulein rottenmeier
i do not remember replied heidi
what a way to answer
said the lady shaking her head
dete is the child a simpleton or only saucy
if the lady will allow me i will speak for the child for she is very unaccustomed to strangers said dete who had given heidi a silent poke for making such an unsuitable answer
she is certainly not stupid nor yet saucy she does not know what it means even she speaks exactly as she thinks
today she is for the first time in a gentlemans house and she does not know good manners but she is docile and very willing to learn if the lady will kindly make excuses for her
she was christened adelaide after her mother my sister who is now dead
well thats a name that one can pronounce remarked fraulein rottenmeier
but i must tell you dete that i am astonished to see so young a child
i told you that i wanted a companion of the same age as the young lady of the house one who could share her lessons and all her other occupations
fraulein clara is now over twelve what age is this child
if the lady will allow me began dete again in her usual fluent manner i myself had lost count of her exact age she is certainly a little younger but not much i cannot say precisely but i think she is ten or thereabouts
grandfather told me i was eight put in heidi
dete gave her another poke but as the child had not the least idea why she did so she was not at all confused
whatonly eight
cried fraulein rottenmeier angrily
four years too young
of what use is such a child
and what have you learnt
what books did you have to learn from
none said heidi
how
how then did you learn to read
continued the lady
i have never learnt to read or peter either heidi informed her
mercy upon us
you do not know how to read
is it really so
exclaimed fraulein rottenmeier greatly horrified
is it possiblenot able to read
what have you learnt then
nothing said heidi with unflinching truthfulness
young woman said the lady to dete after having paused for a minute or two to recover from her shock this is not at all the sort of companion you led me to suppose how could you think of bringing me a child like this
but dete was not to be put down so easily and answered warmly if the lady will allow me the child is exactly what i thought she required the lady described what she wished for a child unlike all other children and i could find no other to suit for the greater number i know are not peculiar but one very much the same as the other and i thought this child seemed as if made for the place
but i must go now for my mistress will be waiting for me if the lady will permit i will come again soon and see how she is getting on
and with a bow dete quickly left the room and ran downstairs
fraulein rottenmeier stood for a moment taken aback and then ran after dete
if the child was to stop she had many things yet to say and ask about her and there the child was and what was more dete as she plainly saw meant to leave her there
heidi remained by the door where she had been standing since she first came in
clara had looked on during the interview without speaking now she beckoned to heidi and said come here
heidi went up to her
would you rather be called heidi or adelaide
asked clara
i am never called anything but heidi was the childs prompt answer
then i shall always call you by that name said clara it suits you
i have never heard it before but neither have i ever seen a child like you before
have you always had that short curly hair
yes i think so said heidi
are you pleased to come to frankfurt
went on clara
no but i shall go home tomorrow and take grandmother a white loaf explained heidi
well you are a funny child
exclaimed clara
you were expressly sent for to come here and to remain with me and share my lessons there will be some fun about them now as you cannot read something new to do for often they are dreadfully dull and i think the morning will never pass away
you know my tutor comes every morning at about ten oclock and then we go on with lessons till two and it does seem such a long time
sometimes he takes up the book and holds it close up to his face as if he was very shortsighted but i know its only because he wants so dreadfully to gape and fraulein rottenmeier takes her large handkerchief out also now and then and covers her face with it as if she was moved by what we had been reading but that is only because she is longing to gape too
and i myself often want to gape but i am obliged to stop myself for if fraulein rottenmeier sees me gaping she runs off at once and fetches the codliver oil and says i must have a dose as i am getting weak again and the codliver oil is horrible so i do my best not to gape
but now it will be much more amusing for i shall be able to lie and listen while you learn to read
heidi shook her head doubtfully when she heard of learning to read
oh nonsense heidi of course you must learn to read everybody must and my tutor is very kind and never cross and he will explain everything to you
but mind when he explains anything to you you wont be able to understand but dont ask any questions or else he will go on explaining and you will understand less than ever
later when you have learnt more and know about things yourself then you will begin to understand what he meant
fraulein rottenmeier now came back into the room she had not been able to overtake dete and was evidently very much put out for she had wanted to go into more details concerning the child and to convince dete how misleading she had been and how unfit heidi was as a companion for clara she really did not know what to be about or how to undo the mischief and it made her all the more angry that she herself was responsible for it having consented to heidi being fetched
she ran backwards and forwards in a state of agitation between the study and the diningroom and then began scolding sebastian who was standing looking at the table he had just finished laying to see that nothing was missing
you can finish your thoughts tomorrow morning make haste or we shall get no dinner today at all
then hurrying out she called tinette but in such an ill tempered voice that the maid came tripping forward with even more mincing steps than usual but she looked so pert that even fraulein rottenmeier did not venture to scold her which only made her suppressed anger the greater
see that the room is prepared for the little girl who has just arrived said the lady with a violent effort at selfcontrol
everything is ready it only wants dusting
its worth my troubling about said tinette mockingly as she turned away
meanwhile sebastian had flung open the folding doors leading into the diningroom with rather more noise than he need for he was feeling furious although he did not dare answer back when fraulein rottenmeier spoke to him he then went up to claras chair to wheel her into the next room
as he was arranging the handle at the back preparatory to doing so heidi went near and stood staring at him
seeing her eyes fixed upon him he suddenly growled out well what is there in me to stare at like that
which he would certainly not have done if he had been aware that fraulein rottenmeier was just then entering the room
you look so like peter answered heidi
the ladyhousekeeper clasped her hands in horror
she stammered half aloud she is now addressing the servant as if he were a friend
i never could have imagined such a child
sebastian wheeled the couch into the diningroom and helped clara on to her chair
fraulein rottenmeier took the seat beside her and made a sign to heidi to take the one opposite
they were the only three at table and as they sat far apart there was plenty of room for sebastian to hand his dishes
beside heidis plate lay a nice white roll and her eyes lighted up with pleasure as she saw it
the resemblance which heidi had noticed had evidently awakened in her a feeling of confidence towards sebastian for she sat as still as a mouse and without moving until he came up to her side and handed her the dish of fish then she looked at the roll and asked can i have it
sebastian nodded throwing a side glance at fraulein rottenmeier to see what effect this request would have upon her
heidi immediately seized the roll and put it in her pocket
sebastians face became convulsed he was overcome with inward laughter but knew his place too well to laugh aloud
mute and motionless he still remained standing beside heidi it was not his duty to speak nor to move away until she had helped herself
heidi looked wonderingly at him for a minute or two and then said am i to eat some of that too
sebastian nodded again
give me some then she said looking calmly at her plate
at this sebastians command of his countenance became doubtful and the dish began to tremble suspiciously in his hands
you can put the dish on the table and come back presently said fraulein rottenmeier with a severe expression of face
sebastian disappeared on the spot
as for you adelaide i see i shall have to teach you the first rules of behavior continued the ladyhousekeeper with a sigh
i will begin by explaining to you how you are to conduct yourself at table and she went on to give heidi minute instructions as to all she was to do
and now she continued i must make you particularly understand that you are not to speak to sebastian at table or at any other time unless you have an order to give him or a necessary question to put to him and then you are not to address him as if he was some one belonging to you
never let me hear you speak to him in that way again
it is the same with tinette and for myself you are to address me as you hear others doing
clara must herself decide what you are to call her
why clara of course put the latter
then followed a long list of rules as to general behavior getting up and going to bed going in and out of the room shutting the doors keeping everything tidy during the course of which heidis eyes gradually closed for she had been up before five oclock that morning and had had a long journey
she leant back in her chair and fell fast asleep
fraulein rottenmeier having at last come to the end of her sermonizing said now remember what i have said adelaide
have you understood it all
heidi has been asleep for ever so long said clara her face rippling all over with amusement for she had not had such an entertaining dinner for a long time
it is really insupportable what one has to go through with this child exclaimed fraulein rottenmeier in great indignation and she rang the bell so violently that tinette and sebastian both came running in and nearly tumbling over one another but no noise was sufficient to wake heidi and it was with difficulty they could rouse her sufficiently to get her along to her bedroom to reach which she had to pass first through the study then through claras bedroom then through fraulein rottenmeiers sittingroom till she came to the corner room that had been set apart for her
fraulein rottenmeier spends an uncomfortable day when heidi opened her eyes on her first morning in frankfurt she could not think where she was
then she rubbed them and looked about her
she was sitting up in a high white bed on one side of a large wide room into which the light was falling through very very long white curtains near the window stood two chairs covered with large flowers and then came a sofa with the same flowers in front of which was a round table in the corner was a washstand with things upon it that heidi had never seen in her life before
but now all at once she remembered that she was in frankfurt everything that had happened the day before came back to her and finally she recalled clearly the instructions that had been given her by the ladyhousekeeper as far as she had heard them
heidi jumped out of bed and dressed herself then she ran first to one window and then another she wanted to see the sky and country outside she felt like a bird in a cage behind those great curtains
but they were too heavy for her to put aside so she crept underneath them to get to the window
but these again were so high that she could only just get her head above the sill to peer out
even then she could not see what she longed for
in vain she went first to one and then the other of the windowsshe could see nothing but walls and windows and again walls and windows
heidi felt quite frightened
it was still early for heidi was accustomed to get up early and run out at once to see how everything was looking if the sky was blue and if the sun was already above the mountains or if the fir trees were waving and the flowers had opened their eyes
as a bird when it first finds itself in its bright new cage darts hither and thither trying the bars in turn to see if it cannot get through them and fly again into the open so heidi continued to run backwards and forwards trying to open first one and then the other of the windows for she felt she could not bear to see nothing but walls and windows and somewhere outside there must be the green grass and the last unmelted snows on the mountain slopes which heidi so longed to see
but the windows remained immovable try what heidi would to open them even endeavoring to push her little fingers under them to lift them up but it was all no use
when after a while heidi saw that her efforts were fruitless she gave up trying and began to think whether she would not go out and round the house till she came to the grass but then she remembered that the night before she had only seen stones in front of the house
at that moment a knock came to the door and immediately after tinette put her head inside and said breakfast is ready
heidi had no idea what an invitation so worded meant and tinettes face did not encourage any questioning on heidis part but rather the reverse
heidi was sharp enough to read its expression and acted accordingly
so she drew the little stool out from under the table put it in the corner and sat down upon it and there silently awaited what would happen next
shortly after with a good deal of rustling and bustling fraulein rottenmeier appeared who again seemed very much put out and called to heidi what is the matter with you adelheid
dont you understand what breakfast is
come along at once
heidi had no difficulty in understanding now and followed at once
clara had been some time at the breakfast table and she gave heidi a kindly greeting her face looking considerably more cheerful than usual for she looked forward to all kinds of new things happening again that day
breakfast passed off quietly heidi ate her bread and butter in a perfectly correct manner and when the meal was over and clara wheeled back into the study fraulein rottenmeier told her to follow and remain with clara until the tutor should arrive and lessons begin
as soon as the children were alone again heidi asked how can one see out from here and look right down on to the ground
you must open the window and look out replied clara amused
but the windows wont open responded heidi sadly
yes they will clara assured her
you cannot open them nor i either but when you see sebastian you can ask him to open one
it was a great relief to heidi to know that the windows could be opened and that one could look out for she still felt as if she was shut up in prison
clara now began to ask her questions about her home and heidi was delighted to tell her all about the mountain and the goats and the flowery meadows which were so dear to her
meanwhile her tutor had arrived fraulein rottenmeier however did not bring him straight into the study but drew him first aside into the diningroom where she poured forth her troubles and explained to him the awkward position in which she was placed and how it had all come about
it appeared that she had written some time back to herr sesemann to tell him that his daughter very much wished to have a companion and had added how desirable she thought it herself as it would be a spur to clara at her lessons and an amusement for her in her playtime
fraulein rottenmeier had privately wished for this arrangement on her own behalf as it would relieve her from having always to entertain the sick girl herself which she felt at times was too much for her
the father had answered that he was quite willing to let his daughter have a companion provided she was treated in every way like his own child as he would not have any child tormented or put upon which was a very unnecessary remark put in fraulein rottenmeier for who wants to torment children
but now she went on to explain how dreadfully she had been taken in about the child and related all the unimaginable things of which she had already been guilty so that not only would he have to begin with teaching her the a b c but would have to start with the most rudimentary instruction as regarded everything to do with daily life
she could see only one way out of this disastrous state of affairs and that was for the tutor to declare that it was impossible for the two to learn together without detriment to clara who was so far ahead of the other that would be a valid excuse for getting rid of the child and herr sesemann would be sure to agree to the child being sent home again but she dared not do this without his order since he was aware that by this time the companion had arrived
but the tutor was a cautious man and not inclined to take a partial view of matters
he tried to calm fraulein rottenmeier and gave it as his opinion that if the little girl was backward in some things she was probably advanced in others and a little regular teaching would soon set the balance right
when fraulein rottenmeier saw that he was not ready to support her and evidently quite ready to undertake teaching the alphabet she opened the study door which she quickly shut again as soon as he had gone through remaining on the other side herself for she had a perfect horror of the a b c
she walked up and down the diningroom thinking over in her own mind how the servants were to be told to address adelaide
the father had written that she was to be treated exactly like his own daughter and this would especially refer she imagined to the servants
she was not allowed however a very long interval of time for consideration for suddenly the sound of a frightful crash was heard in the study followed by frantic cries for sebastian
she rushed into the room
there on the floor lay in a confused heap books exercisebooks inkstand and other articles with the tablecloth on the top while from beneath them a dark stream of ink was flowing all across the floor
heidi had disappeared
heres a state of things
exclaimed fraulein rottenmeier wringing her hands
tablecloth books workbasket everything lying in the ink
it was that unfortunate child i suppose
the tutor was standing looking down at the havoc in distress there was certainly only one view to be taken of such a matter as this and that an unfavorable one
clara meanwhile appeared to find pleasure in such an unusual event and in watching the results
yes heidi did it she explained but quite by accident she must on no account be punished she jumped up in such violent haste to get away that she dragged the tablecloth along with her and so everything went over
there were a number of vehicles passing that is why she rushed off like that perhaps she has never seen a carriage
is it not as i said
she has not the smallest notion about anything
not the slightest idea that she ought to sit still and listen while her lessons are going on
but where is the child who has caused all this trouble
surely she has not run away
what would herr sesemann say to me
she ran out of the room and down the stairs
there at the bottom standing in the open door way was heidi looking in amazement up and down the street
what are you doing
what are you thinking of to run away like that
called fraulein rottenmeier
i heard the sound of the fir trees but i cannot see where they are and now i cannot hear them any more answered heidi looking disappointedly in the direction whence the noise of the passing carriages had reached her and which to heidi had seemed like the blowing of the south wind in the trees so that in great joy of heart she had rushed out to look at them
fir trees
do you suppose we are in a wood
what ridiculous ideas are these
come upstairs and see the mischief you have done
heidi turned and followed fraulein rottenmeier upstairs she was quite astonished to see the disaster she had caused for in her joy and haste to get to the fir trees she had been unaware of having dragged everything after her
i excuse you doing this as it is the first time but do not let me know you doing it a second time said fraulein rottenmeier pointing to the floor
during your lesson time you are to sit still and attend
if you cannot do this i shall have to tie you to your chair
do you understand
yes replied heidi but i will certainly not move again for now she understood that it was a rule to sit still while she was being taught
sebastian and tinette were now sent for to clear up the broken articles and put things in order again the tutor said good morning and left as it was impossible to do any more lessons that day there had been certainly no time for gaping this morning
clara had to rest for a certain time during the afternoon and during this interval as fraulein rottenmeier informed heidi the latter might amuse herself as she liked
when clara had been placed on her couch after dinner and the ladyhousekeeper had retired to her room heidi knew that her time had come to choose her own occupation
it was just what she was longing for as there was something she had made up her mind to do but she would require some help for its accomplishment and in view of this she took her stand in the hall in front of the diningroom door in order to intercept the person she wanted
in a few minutes up came sebastian from the kitchen with a tray of silver teathings which he had to put away in the diningroom cupboard
as he reached the top stairs heidi went up to him and addressed him in the formal manner she had been ordered to use by fraulein rottenmeier
sebastian looked surprised and said somewhat curtly what is it you want miss
i only wished to ask you something but it is nothing bad like this morning said heidi anxious to conciliate him for she saw that sebastian was rather in a cross temper and quite thought that it was on account of the ink she had spilt on the floor
indeed and why i should first like to know do you address me like that
replied sebastian evidently still put out
fraulein rottenmeier told me always to speak to you like that said heidi
then sebastian laughed which very much astonished heidi who had seen nothing amusing in the conversation but sebastian now he understood that the child was only obeying orders added in a friendly voice what is it then that miss wants
it was now heidis turn to be a little put out and she said my name is not miss it is heidi
quite so but the same lady has ordered me to call you miss explained sebastian
has she
oh then i must be called so said heidi submissively for she had already noticed that whatever fraulein rottenmeier said was law
then now i have three names she added with a sigh
what was it little miss wished to ask
said sebastian as he went on into the diningroom to put away his silver
how can a window be opened
why like that
and sebastian flung up one of the large windows
heidi ran to it but she was not tall enough to see out for her head only reached the sill
there now miss can look out and see what is going on below said sebastian as he brought her a high wooden stool to stand on
heidi climbed up and at last as she thought was going to see what she had been longing for
but she drew back her head with a look of great disappointment on her face
why there is nothing outside but the stony streets she said mournfully but if i went right round to the other side of the house what should i see there sebastian
nothing but what you see here he told her
then where can i go to see right away over the whole valley
you would have to climb to the top of a high tower a church tower like that one over there with the gold ball above it
from there you can see right away ever so far
heidi climbed down quickly from her stool ran to the door down the steps and out into the street
things were not however quite so easy as she thought
looking from the window the tower had appeared so close that she imagined she had only to run over the road to reach it
but now although she ran along the whole length of the street she still did not get any nearer to it and indeed soon lost sight of it altogether she turned down another street and went on and on but still no tower
she passed a great many people but they all seemed in such a hurry that heidi thought they had not time to tell her which way to go
then suddenly at one of the street corners she saw a boy standing carrying a handorgan on his back and a funnylooking animal on his arm
heidi ran up to him and said where is the tower with the gold ball on the top
i dont know was the answer
who can i ask to show me
she asked again
i dont know
do you know any other church with a high tower
yes i know one
come then and show it me
show me first what you will give me for it and the boy held out his hand as he spoke
heidi searched about in her pockets and presently drew out a card on which was painted a garland of beautiful red roses she looked at it first for a moment or two for she felt rather sorry to part with it clara had only that morning made her a present of itbut then to look down into the valley and see all the lovely green slopes
there said heidi holding out the card would you like to have that
the boy drew back his hand and shook his head
what would you like then
asked heidi not sorry to put the card back in her pocket
money
i have none but clara has i am sure she will give me some how much do you want
twopence
come along then
they started off together along the street and on the way heidi asked her companion what he was carrying on his back it was a handorgan he told her which played beautiful music when he turned the handle
all at once they found themselves in front of an old church with a high tower the boy stood still and said there it is
but how shall i get inside
asked heidi looking at the fast closed doors
do you think that i can ring as they do for sebastian
heidi had by this time caught sight of a bell in the wall which she now pulled with all her might
if i go up you must stay down here for i do not know the way back and you will have to show me
what will you give me then for that
what do you want me to give you
another twopence
they heard the key turning inside and then some one pulled open the heavy creaking door an old man came out and at first looked with surprise and then in anger at the children as he began scolding them what do you mean by ringing me down like this
cant you read what is written over the bell for those who wish to go up the tower
the boy said nothing but pointed his finger at heidi
the latter answered but i do want to go up the tower
what do you want up there
has somebody sent you
no replied heidi i only wanted to go up that i might look down
get along home with you and dont try this trick on me again or you may not come off so easily a second time and with that he turned and was about to shut the door
but heidi took hold of his coat and said beseechingly let me go up just once
he looked around and his mood changed as he saw her pleading eyes he took hold of her hand and said kindly well if you really wish it so much i will take you
the boy sat down on the church steps to show that he was content to wait where he was
hand in hand with the old man heidi went up the many steps of the tower they became smaller and smaller as they neared the top and at last came one very narrow one and there they were at the end of their climb
the old man lifted heidi up that she might look out of the open window
there now you can look down he said
heidi saw beneath her a sea of roofs towers and chimneypots she quickly drew back her head and said in a sad disappointed voice it is not at all what i thought
you see now a child like you does not understand anything about a view
come along down and dont go ringing at my bell again
he lifted her down and went on before her down the narrow stairway
to the left of the turn where it grew wider stood the door of the towerkeepers room and the landing ran out beside it to the edge of the steep slanting roof
at the far end of this was a large basket in front of which sat a big grey cat that snarled as it saw them for she wished to warn the passers by that they were not to meddle with her family
heidi stood still and looked at her in astonishment for she had never seen such a monster cat before there were whole armies of mice however in the old tower so the cat had no difficulty in catching half a dozen for her dinner every day
the old man seeing heidi so struck with admiration said she will not hurt you while i am near come you can have a peep at the kittens
heidi went up to the basket and broke out into expressions of delight
oh the sweet little things
the darling kittens she kept on saying as she jumped from side to side of the basket so as not to lose any of the droll gambols of the seven or eight little kittens that were scrambling and rolling and falling over one another
would you like to have one
said the old man who enjoyed watching the childs pleasure
for myself to keep
said heidi excitedly who could hardly believe such happiness was to be hers
yes of course more than one if you likein short you can take away the whole lot if you have room for them for the old man was only too glad to think he could get rid of his kittens without more trouble
heidi could hardly contain herself for joy
there would be plenty of room for them in the large house and then how astonished and delighted clara would be when she saw the sweet little kittens
but how can i take them with me
asked heidi and was going quickly to see how many she could carry away in her hands when the old cat sprang at her so fiercely that she shrank back in fear
i will take them for you if you will tell me where said the old man stroking the cat to quiet her for she was an old friend of his that had lived with him in the tower for many years
to herr sesemanns the big house where there is a gold dogs head on the door with a ring in its mouth explained heidi
such full directions as these were not really needed by the old man who had had charge of the tower for many a long year and knew every house far and near and moreover sebastian was an acquaintance of his
i know the house he said but when shall i bring them and who shall i ask for
you are not one of the family i am sure
no but clara will be so delighted when i take her the kittens
the old man wished now to go downstairs but heidi did not know how to tear herself away from the amusing spectacle
if i could just take one or two away with me
one for myself and one for clara may i
well wait a moment said the man and he drew the cat cautiously away into his room and leaving her by a bowl of food came out again and shut the door
now take two of them
heidis eyes shone with delight
she picked up a white kitten and another striped white and yellow and put one in the right the other in the left pocket
then she went downstairs
the boy was still sitting outside on the steps and as the old man shut the door of the church behind them she said which is our way to herr sesemanns house
heidi began a description of the front door and the steps and the windows but the boy only shook his head and was not any the wiser
well look here continued heidi from one window you can see a very very large grey house and the roof runs like this and heidi drew a zigzag line in the air with her forefinger
with this the boy jumped up he was evidently in the habit of guiding himself by similar landmarks
he ran straight off with heidi after him and in a very short time they had reached the door with the large dogs head for the knocker
heidi rang the bell
sebastian opened it quickly and when he saw it was heidi make haste
make haste he cried in a hurried voice
heidi sprang hastily in and sebastian shut the door after her leaving the boy whom he had not noticed standing in wonder on the steps
make haste little miss said sebastian again go straight into the diningroom they are already at table fraulein rottenmeier looks like a loaded cannon
what could make the little miss run off like that
heidi walked into the room
the lady housekeeper did not look up clara did not speak there was an uncomfortable silence
sebastian pushed her chair up for her and when she was seated fraulein rottenmeier with a severe countenance sternly and solemnly addressed her i will speak with you afterwards adelheid only this much will i now say that you behaved in a most unmannerly and reprehensible way by running out of the house as you did without asking permission without any one knowing a word about it and then to go wandering about till this hour i never heard of such behavior before
miau
came the answer back
this was too much for the ladys temper with raised voice she exclaimed you dare adelheid after your bad behavior to answer me as if it were a joke
i did not began heidimiau
sebastian almost dropped his dish and rushed out of the room
that will do fraulein rottenmeier tried to say but her voice was almost stifled with anger
get up and leave the room
heidi stood up frightened and again made an attempt to explain
i really did not miau
but heidi now put in clara when you see that it makes fraulein rottenmeier angry why do you keep on saying miau
it isnt i its the kittens heidi was at last given time to say
kittens
shrieked fraulein rottenmeier
sebastian
tinette
find the horrid little things
take them away
and she rose and fled into the study and locked the door so as to make sure that she was safe from the kittens which to her were the most horrible things in creation
sebastian was obliged to wait a few minutes outside the door to get over his laughter before he went into the room again
he had while serving heidi caught sight of a little kittens head peeping out of her pocket and guessing the scene that would follow had been so overcome with amusement at the first miaus that he had hardly been able to finish handing the dishes
the ladys distressed cries for help had ceased before he had sufficiently regained his composure to go back into the dining room
it was all peace and quietness there now clara had the kittens on her lap and heidi was kneeling beside her both laughing and playing with the tiny graceful little animals
sebastian exclaimed clara as he came in you must help us you must find a bed for the kittens where fraulein rottenmeier will not spy them out for she is so afraid of them that she will send them away at once but we want to keep them and have them out whenever we are alone
where can you put them
i will see to that answered sebastian willingly
i will make a bed in a basket and put it in some place where the lady is not likely to go you leave it to me
he set about the work at once sniggling to himself the while for he guessed there would be a further rumpus about this some day and sebastian was not without a certain pleasure in the thought of fraulein rottenmeier being a little disturbed
not until some time had elapsed and it was nearing the hour for going to bed did fraulein rottenmeier venture to open the door a crack and call through have you taken those dreadful little animals away sebastian
he assured her twice that he had done so he had been hanging about the room in anticipation of this question and now quickly and quietly caught up the kittens from claras lap and disappeared with them
the castigatory sermon which fraulein rottenmeier had held in reserve for heidi was put off till the following day as she felt too exhausted now after all the emotions she had gone through of irritation anger and fright of which heidi had unconsciously been the cause
she retired without speaking clara and heidi following happy in their minds at knowing that the kittens were lying in a comfortable bed
there is great commotion in the large house sebastian had just shown the tutor into the study on the following morning when there came another and very loud ring at the bell which sebastian ran quickly to answer
only herr sesemann rings like that he said to himself he must have returned home unexpectedly
he pulled open the door and there in front of him he saw a ragged little boy carrying a handorgan on his back
whats the meaning of this
said sebastian angrily
ill teach you to ring bells like that
what do you want here
i want to see clara the boy answered
you dirty goodfornothing little rascal cant you be polite enough to say miss clara
what do you want with her
continued sebastian roughly
she owes me fourpence explained the boy
you must be out of your mind
and how do you know that any young lady of that name lives here
she owes me twopence for showing her the way there and twopence for showing her the way back
see what a pack of lies you are telling
the young lady never goes out cannot even walk be off and get back to where you came from before i have to help you along
but the boy was not to be frightened away he remained standing and said in a determined voice but i saw her in the street and can describe her to you she has short curly black hair and black eyes and wears a brown dress and does not talk quite like we do
oho
thought sebastian laughing to himself the little miss has evidently been up to more mischief
then drawing the boy inside he said aloud i understand now come with me and wait outside the door till i tell you to go in
be sure you begin playing your organ the instant you get inside the room the lady is very fond of music
sebastian knocked at the study door and a voice said come in
there is a boy outside who says he must speak to miss clara herself sebastian announced
clara was delighted at such an extraordinary and unexpected message
let him come in at once replied clara he must come in must he not she added turning to her tutor if he wishes so particularly to see me
the boy was already inside the room and according to sebastians directions immediately began to play his organ
fraulein rottenmeier wishing to escape the a b c had retired with her work to the diningroom
all at once she stopped and listened
did those sounds come up from the street
and yet they seemed so near
but how could there be an organ playing in the study
and yetit surely was so
she rushed to the other end of the long diningroom and tore open the door
she could hardly believe her eyes
there in the middle of the study stood a ragged boy turning away at his organ in the most energetic manner
the tutor appeared to be making efforts to speak but his voice could not be heard
both children were listening delightedly to the music
leave off
leave off at once
screamed fraulein rottenmeier
but her voice was drowned by the music
she was making a dash for the boy when she saw something on the ground crawling towards her feeta dreadful dark objecta tortoise
at this sight she jumped higher than she had for many long years before shrieking with all her might sebastian
the organplayer suddenly stopped for this time her voice had risen louder than the music
sebastian was standing outside bent double with laughter for he had been peeping to see what was going on
by the time he entered the room fraulein rottenmeier had sunk into a chair
take them all out boy and animal
get them away at once
she commanded him
sebastian pulled the boy away the latter having quickly caught up the tortoise and when he had got him outside he put something into his hand
there is the fourpence from miss clara and another fourpence for the music
you did it all quite right
and with that he shut the front door upon him
quietness reigned again in the study and lessons began once more fraulein rottenmeier now took up her station in the study in order by her presence to prevent any further dreadful goings on
but soon another knock came to the door and sebastian again stepped in this time to say that some one had brought a large basket with orders that it was to be given at once to miss clara
for me
said clara in astonishment her curiosity very much excited bring it in at once that i may see what it is like
sebastian carried in a large covered basket and retired
i think the lessons had better be finished first before the basket is unpacked said fraulein rottenmeier
clara could not conceive what was in it and cast longing glances towards it
in the middle of one of her declensions she suddenly broke off and said to the tutor maynt i just give one peep inside to see what is in it before i go on
on some considerations i am for it on others against it he began in answer for it on the ground that if your whole attention is directed to the basket but the speech remained unfinished
the cover of the basket was loose and at this moment one two three and then two more and again more kittens came suddenly tumbling on to the floor and racing about the room in every direction and with such indescribable rapidity that it seemed as if the whole room was full of them
they jumped over the tutors boots bit at his trousers climbed up fraulein rottenmeiers dress rolled about her feet sprang up on to claras couch scratching scrambling and mewing it was a sad scene of confusion
clara meanwhile pleased with their gambols kept on exclaiming oh the dear little things
how pretty they are
look heidi at this one look look at that one over there
and heidi in her delight kept running after them first into one corner and then into the other
the tutor stood up by the table not knowing what to do lifting first his right foot and then his left to get it away from the scrambling scratching kittens
fraulein rottenmeier was unable at first to speak at all so overcome was she with horror and she did not dare rise from her chair for fear that all the dreadful little animals should jump upon her at once
at last she found voice to call loudly tinette
they came in answer to her summons and gathered up the kittens by degrees they got them all inside the basket again and then carried them off to put with the other two
today again there had been no opportunity for gaping
late that evening when fraulein rottenmeier had somewhat recovered from the excitement of the morning she sent for the two servants and examined them closely concerning the events of the morning
and then it came out that heidi was at the bottom of them everything being the result of her excursion of the day before
fraulein rottenmeier sat pale with indignation and did not know at first how to express her anger
then she made a sign to tinette and sebastian to withdraw and turning to heidi who was standing by claras couch quite unable to understand of what sin she had been guilty began in a severe voice adelaide i know of only one punishment which will perhaps make you alive to your ill conduct for you are an utter little barbarian but we will see if we cannot tame you so that you shall not be guilty of such deeds again by putting you in a dark cellar with the rats and black beetles
heidi listened in silence and surprise to her sentence for she had never seen a cellar such as was now described the place known at her grandfathers as the cellar where the fresh made cheeses and the new milk were kept was a pleasant and inviting place neither did she know at all what rats and black beetles were like
but now clara interrupted in great distress
no no fraulein rottenmeier you must wait till papa comes he has written to say that he will soon be home and then i will tell him everything and he will say what is to be done with heidi
fraulein rottenmeier could not do anything against this superior authority especially as the father was really expected very shortly
she rose and said with some displeasure as you will clara but i too shall have something to say to herr sesemann
and with that she left the room
two days now went by without further disturbance
fraulein rottenmeier however could not recover her equanimity she was perpetually reminded by heidis presence of the deception that had been played upon her and it seemed to her that ever since the child had come into the house everything had been topsy turvy and she could not bring things into proper order again
clara had grown much more cheerful she no longer found time hang heavy during the lesson hours for heidi was continually making a diversion of some kind or other
she jumbled all her letters up together and seemed quite unable to learn them and when the tutor tried to draw her attention to their different shapes and to help her by showing her that this was like a little horn or that like a birds bill she would suddenly exclaim in a joyful voice that is a goat
that is a bird of prey
for the tutors descriptions suggested all kinds of pictures to her mind but left her still incapable of the alphabet
in the later afternoons heidi always sat with clara and then she would give the latter many and long descriptions of the mountain and of her life upon it and the burning longing to return would become so overpowering that she always finished with the words now i must go home
tomorrow i must really go
but clara would try to quiet her and tell heidi that she must wait till her father returned and then they would see what was to be done
and if heidi gave in each time and seemed quickly to regain her good spirits it was because of a secret delight she had in the thought that every day added two more white rolls to the number she was collecting for grandmother for she always pocketed the roll placed beside her plate at dinner and supper feeling that she could not bear to eat them knowing that grandmother had no white bread and could hardly eat the black bread which was so hard
after dinner heidi had to sit alone in her room for a couple of hours for she understood now that she might not run about outside at frankfurt as she did on the mountain and so she did not attempt it
any conversation with sebastian in the dining room was also forbidden her and as to tinette she kept out of her way and never thought of speaking to her for heidi was quite aware that the maid looked scornfully at her and always spoke to her in a mocking voice
so heidi had plenty of time from day to day to sit and picture how everything at home was now turning green and how the yellow flowers were shining in the sun and how all around lay bright in the warm sunshine the snow and the rocks and the whole wide valley and heidi at times could hardly contain herself for the longing to be back home again
and dete had told her that she could go home whenever she liked
so it came about one day that heidi felt she could not bear it any longer and in haste she tied all the rolls up in her red shawl put on her straw hat and went downstairs
but just as she reached the halldoor she met fraulein rottenmeier herself just returning from a walk which put a stop to heidis journey
fraulein rottenmeier stood still a moment looking at her from top to toe in blank astonishment her eye resting particularly on the red bundle
then she broke out what have you dressed yourself like that for
what do you mean by this
have i not strictly forbidden you to go running about in the streets
and here you are ready to start off again and going out looking like a beggar
i was not going to run about i was going home said heidi frightened
what are you talking about
going home
you want to go home
exclaimed fraulein rottenmeier her anger rising
to run away like that
what would herr sesemann say if he knew
take care that he never hears of this
and what is the matter with his house i should like to know
have you not been better treated than you deserved
have you wanted for a thing
have you ever in your life before had such a house to live in such a table or so many to wait upon you
have you
no replied heidi
i should think not indeed
continued the exasperated lady
you have everything you can possibly want here and you are an ungrateful little thing its because you are too well off and comfortable that you have nothing to do but think what naughty thing you can do next
then heidis feelings got the better of her and she poured forth her trouble
indeed i only want to go home for if i stay so long away snowflake will begin crying again and grandmother is waiting for me and greenfinch will get beaten because i am not there to give peter any cheese and i can never see how the sun says goodnight to the mountains and if the great bird were to fly over frankfurt he would croak louder than ever about people huddling all together and teaching each other bad things and not going to live up on the rocks where it is so much better
heaven have mercy on us the child is out of her mind
cried fraulein rottenmeier and she turned in terror and went quickly up the steps running violently against sebastian in her hurry
go and bring that unhappy little creature in at once she ordered him putting her hand to her forehead which she had bumped against his
sebastian did as he was told rubbing his own head as he went for he had received a still harder blow
heidi had not moved she stood with her eyes aflame and trembling all over with inward agitation
what got into trouble again
said sebastian in a cheerful voice but when he looked more closely at heidi and saw that she did not move he put his hand kindly on her shoulder and said trying to comfort her there there dont take it to heart so much keep up your spirits that is the great thing
she has nearly made a hole in my head but dont you let her bully you
then seeing that heidi still did not stir we must go she ordered me to take you in
heidi now began mounting the stairs but with a slow crawling step very unlike her usual manner
sebastian felt quite sad as he watched her and as he followed her up he kept trying to encourage her
dont you give in
dont let her make you unhappy
you keep up your courage
why weve got such a sensible little miss that she has never cried once since she was here many at that age cry a good dozen times a day
the kittens are enjoying themselves very much up in their home they jump about all over the place and behave as if they were little mad things
later we will go up and see them when fraulein is out of the way shall we
heidi gave a little nod of assent but in such a joyless manner that it went to sebastians heart and he followed her with sympathetic eyes as she crept away to her room
at supper that evening fraulein rottenmeier did not speak but she cast watchful looks towards heidi as if expecting her at any minute to break out in some extraordinary way but heidi sat without moving or eating all that she did was to hastily hide her roll in her pocket
when the tutor arrived next morning fraulein rottenmeier drew him privately aside and confided her fear to him that the change of air and the new mode of life and unaccustomed surroundings had turned heidis head then she told him of the incident of the day before and of heidis strange speech
but the tutor assured her she need not be in alarm he had already become aware that the child was somewhat eccentric but otherwise quite right in her mind and he was sure that with careful treatment and education the right balance would be restored and it was this he was striving after
he was the more convinced of this by what he now heard and by the fact that he had so far failed to teach her the alphabet heidi seeming unable to understand the letters
fraulein rottenmeier was considerably relieved by his words and released the tutor to his work
in the course of the afternoon the remembrance of heidis appearance the day before as she was starting out on her travels suddenly returned to the lady and she made up her mind that she would supplement the childs clothing with various garments from claras wardrobe so as to give her a decent appearance when herr sesemann returned
she confided her intention to clara who was quite willing to make over any number of dresses and hats to heidi so the lady went upstairs to overhaul the childs belongings and see what was to be kept and what thrown away
she returned however in the course of a few minutes with an expression of horror upon her face
what is this adelaide that i find in your wardrobe
she exclaimed
i never heard of any one doing such a thing before
in a cupboard meant for clothes adelaide what do i see at the bottom but a heap of rolls
will you believe it clara bread in a wardrobe
a whole pile of bread
tinette she called to that young woman who was in the diningroom go upstairs and take away all those rolls out of adelaides cupboard and the old straw hat on the table
no
screamed heidi
i must keep the hat and the rolls are for grandmother and she was rushing to stop tinette when fraulein rottenmeier took hold of her
you will stop here and all that bread and rubbish shall be taken to the place they belong to she said in a determined tone as she kept her hand on the child to prevent her running forward
then heidi in despair flung herself down on claras couch and broke into a wild fit of weeping her crying becoming louder and more full of distress every minute while she kept on sobbing out at intervals now grandmothers bread is all gone
they were all for grandmother and now they are taken away and grandmother wont have one and she wept as if her heart would break
fraulein rottenmeier ran out of the room
clara was distressed and alarmed at the childs crying
heidi heidi she said imploringly pray do not cry so
listen to me dont be so unhappy look now i promise you that you shall have just as many rolls or more all fresh and new to take to grandmother when you go home yours would have been hard and stale by then
come heidi do not cry any more
heidi could not get over her sobs for a long time she would never have been able to leave off crying at all if it had not been for claras promise which comforted her
but to make sure that she could depend upon it she kept on saying to clara her voice broken with her gradually subsiding sobs will you give me as many quite as many as i had for grandmother
and clara assured her each time that she would give her as many or more she added only be happy again
heidi appeared at supper with her eyes red with weeping and when she saw her roll she could not suppress a sob
but she made an effort to control herself for she knew she must sit quietly at table
whenever sebastian could catch her eye this evening he made all sorts of strange signs pointing to his own head and then to hers and giving little nods as much as to say dont you be unhappy
i have got it all safe for you
when heidi was going to get into bed that night she found her old straw hat lying under the counterpane
she snatched it up with delight made it more out of shape still in her joy and then after wrapping a handkerchief round it she stuck it in a corner of the cupboard as far back as she could
it was sebastian who had hidden it there for her he had been in the diningroom when tinette was called and had heard all that went on with the child and the latters loud weeping
so he followed tinette and when she came out of heidis room carrying the rolls and the hat he caught up the hat and said i will see to this old thing
he was genuinely glad to have been able to save it for heidi and that was the meaning of his encouraging signs to her at supper
herr sesemann hears of things which are new to him a few days after these events there was great commotion and much running up and down stairs in herr sesemanns house
the master had just returned and sebastian and tinette were busy carrying up one package after another from the carriage for herr sesemann always brought back a lot of pretty things for his home
he himself had not waited to do anything before going in to see his daughter
heidi was sitting beside her for it was late afternoon when the two were always together
father and daughter greeted each other with warm affection for they were deeply attached to one another
then he held out his hand to heidi who had stolen away into the corner and said kindly to her and this is our little swiss girl come and shake hands with me
thats right
now tell me are clara and you good friends with one another or do you get angry and quarrel and then cry and make it up and then start quarreling again on the next occasion
no clara is always kind to me answered heidi
and heidi put in clara quickly has not once tried to quarrel
thats all right i am glad to hear it said her father as he rose from his chair
but you must excuse me clara for i want my dinner i have had nothing to eat all day
afterwards i will show you all the things i have brought home with me
he found fraulein rottenmeier in the diningroom superintending the preparation for his meal and when he had taken his place she sat down opposite to him looking the every embodiment of bad news so that he turned to her and said what am i to expect fraulein rottenmeier
you greet me with an expression of countenance that quite frightens me
clara seems cheerful enough
herr sesemann began the lady in a solemn voice it is a matter which concerns clara we have been frightfully imposed upon
indeed in what way
asked herr sesemann as he went on calmly drinking his wine
we had decided as you remember to get a companion for clara and as i knew how anxious you were to have only those who were wellbehaved and nicely brought up about her i thought i would look for a little swiss girl as i hoped to find such a one as i have often read about who born as it were of the mountain air lives and moves without touching the earth
still i think even a swiss child would have to touch the earth if she wanted to go anywhere remarked herr sesemann otherwise they would have been given wings instead of feet
ah herr sesemann you know what i mean continued fraulein rottenmeier
i mean one so at home among the living creatures of the high pure mountain regions that she would be like some idealistic being from another world among us
and what could clara do with such an idealistic being as you describe fraulein rottenmeier
i am not joking herr sesemann the matter is a more serious one than you think i have been shockingly disgracefully imposed upon
but how
what is there shocking and disgraceful
i see nothing shocking in the child remarked herr sesemann quietly
if you only knew of one thing she has done if you only knew of the kind of people and animals she has brought into the house during your absence
the tutor can tell you more about that
animals
what am i to understand by animals fraulein rottenmeier
it is past understanding the whole behavior of the child would be past understanding if it were not that at times she is evidently not in her right mind
herr sesemann had attached very little importance to what was told him up till nowbut not in her right mind
that was more serious and might be prejudicial to his own child
herr sesemann looked very narrowly at the lady opposite to assure himself that the mental aberration was not on her side
at that moment the door opened and the tutor was announced
ah
here is some one exclaimed herr sesemann who will help to clear up matters for me
take a seat he continued as he held out his hand to the tutor
you will drink a cup of coffee with meno ceremony i pray
and now tell me what is the matter with this child that has come to be a companion to my daughter
what is this strange thing i hear about her bringing animals into the house and is she in her right senses
the tutor felt he must begin with expressing his pleasure at herr sesemanns return and with explaining that he had come in on purpose to give him welcome but herr sesemann begged him to explain without delay the meaning of all he had heard about heidi
the tutor started in his usual style
if i must give my opinion about this little girl i should like first to state that if on one side there is a lack of development which has been caused by the more or less careless way in which she has been brought up or rather by the neglect of her education when young and by the solitary life she has led on the mountain which is not wholly to be condemned on the contrary such a life has undoubtedly some advantages in it if not allowed to overstep a certain limit of time my good friend interrupted herr sesemann you are giving yourself more trouble than you need
i only want to know if the child has caused you alarm by any animals she has brought into the house and what your opinion is altogether as to her being a fit companion or not for my daughter
i should not like in any way to prejudice you against her began the tutor once more for if on the one hand there is a certain inexperience of the ways of society owing to the uncivilised life she led up to the time of her removal to frankfurt on the other hand she is endowed with certain good qualities and taken on the whole excuse me my dear sir do not disturb yourself but i musti think my daughter will be wanting me and with that herr sesemann quickly left the room and took care not to return
he sat himself down beside his daughter in the study and then turning to heidi who had risen little one will you fetch me he began and then paused for he could not think what to ask for but he wanted to get the child out of the room for a little while fetch me a glass of water
fresh water
yesyesas fresh as you can get it he answered
heidi disappeared on the spot
and now my dear little clara he said drawing his chair nearer and laying her hand in his answer my questions clearly and intelligibly what kind of animals has your little companion brought into the house and why does fraulein rottenmeier think that she is not always in her right mind
clara had no difficulty in answering
the alarmed lady had spoken to her also about heidis wild manner of talking but clara had not been able to put a meaning to it
she told her father everything about the tortoise and the kittens and explained to him what heidi had said the day fraulein rottenmeier had been put in such a fright
herr sesemann laughed heartily at her recital
so you do not want me to send the child home again he asked you are not tired of having her here
oh no no clara exclaimed please do not send her away
time has passed much more quickly since heidi was here for something fresh happens every day and it used to be so dull and she has always so much to tell me
thats all right thenand here comes your little friend
have you brought me some nice fresh water
he asked as heidi handed him a glass
yes fresh from the pump answered heidi
you did not go yourself to the pump
said clara
yes i did it is quite fresh
i had to go a long way for there were such a lot of people at the first pump so i went further down the street but there were just as many at the second pump but i was able to get some water at the one in the next street and the gentleman with the white hair asked me to give his kind regards to herr sesemann
you have had quite a successful expedition said herr sesemann laughing and who was the gentleman
he was passing and when he saw me he stood still and said as you have a glass will you give me a drink to whom are you taking the water
and when i said to herr sesemann he laughed very much and then he gave me that message for you and also said he hoped you would enjoy the water
oh and who was it i wonder who sent me such good wishes tell me what he was like said herr sesemann
he was kind and laughed and he had a thick gold chain and a gold thing hanging from it with a large red stone and a horses head at the top of his stick
its the doctormy old friend the doctor exclaimed clara and her father at the same moment and herr sesemann smiled to himself at the thought of what his friends opinion must have been of this new way of satisfying his thirst for water
that evening when herr sesemann and fraulein rottenmeier were alone settling the household affairs he informed her that he intended to keep heidi he found the child in a perfectly right state of mind and his daughter liked her as a companion
i desire therefore he continued laying stress upon his words that the child shall be in every way kindly treated and that her peculiarities shall not be looked upon as crimes
if you find her too much for you alone i can hold out a prospect of help for i am shortly expecting my mother here on a long visit and she as you know can get on with anybody whatever they may be like
o yes i know replied fraulein rottenmeier but there was no tone of relief in her voice as she thought of the coming help
herr sesemann was only home for a short time he left for paris again before the fortnight was over comforting clara who could not bear that he should go from her again so soon with the prospect of her grandmothers arrival which was to take place in a few days time
herr sesemann had indeed only just gone when a letter came from frau sesemann announcing her arrival on the following day and stating the hour when she might be expected in order that a carriage should be sent to meet her at the station
clara was overjoyed and talked so much about her grandmother that evening that heidi began also to call her grandmamma which brought down on her a look of displeasure from fraulein rottenmeier this however had no particular effect on heidi for she was accustomed now to being continually in that ladys black books
but as she was going to her room that night fraulein rottenmeier waylaid her and drawing her into her own gave her strict injunctions as to how she was to address frau sesemann when she arrived on no account was she to call her grandmamma but always to say madam to her
said the lady as she saw a perplexed expression on heidis face
the latter had not understood but seeing the severe expression of the ladys face she did not ask for more explanation
another grandmother there was much expectation and preparation about the house on the following evening and it was easy to see that the lady who was coming was one whose opinion was highly thought of and for whom everybody had a great respect
tinette had a new white cap on her head and sebastian collected all the footstools he could find and placed them in convenient spots so that the lady might find one ready to her feet whenever she chose to sit
fraulein rottenmeier went about surveying everything very upright and dignified as if to show that though a rival power was expected her own authority was not going to be extinguished
and now the carriage came driving up to the door and tinette and sebastian ran down the steps followed with a slower and more stately step by the lady who advanced to greet the guest
heidi had been sent up to her room and ordered to remain there until called down as the grandmother would certainly like to see clara alone first
heidi sat herself down in a corner and repeated her instructions over to herself
she had not to wait long before tinette put her head in and said abruptly go downstairs into the study
heidi had not dared to ask fraulein rottenmeier again how she was to address the grandmother she thought the lady had perhaps made a mistake for she had never heard any one called by other than their right name
as she opened the study door she heard a kind voice say ah here comes the child
come along in and let me have a good look at you
heidi walked up to her and said very distinctly in her clear voice goodevening and then wishing to follow her instructions called her what would be in english mr
madam
well
said the grandmother laughing is that how they address people in your home on the mountain
no replied heidi gravely i never knew any one with that name before
nor i either laughed the grandmother again as she patted heidis cheek
never mind
when i am with the children i am always grandmamma you wont forget that name will you
no no heidi assured her i often used to say it at home
i understand said the grandmother with a cheerful little nod of the head
then she looked more closely at heidi giving another nod from time to time and the child looked back at her with steady serious eyes for there was something kind and warm hearted about this newcomer that pleased heidi and indeed everything to do with the grandmother attracted her so that she could not turn her eyes away
she had such beautiful white hair and two long lace ends hung down from the cap on her head and waved gently about her face every time she moved as if a soft breeze were blowing round her which gave heidi a peculiar feeling of pleasure
and what is your name child
the grandmother now asked
i am always called heidi but as i am now to be called adelaide i will try and take care heidi stopped short for she felt a little guilty she had not yet grown accustomed to this name she continued not to respond when fraulein rottenmeier suddenly addressed her by it and the lady was at this moment entering the room
frau sesemann will no doubt agree with me she interrupted that it was necessary to choose a name that could be pronounced easily if only for the sake of the servants
my worthy rottenmeier replied frau sesemann if a person is called heidi and has grown accustomed to that name i call her by the same and so let it be
fraulein rottenmeier was always very much annoyed that the old lady continually addressed her by her surname only but it was no use minding for the grandmother always went her own way and so there was no help for it
moreover the grandmother was a keen old lady and had all her five wits about her and she knew what was going on in the house as soon as she entered it
when on the following day clara lay down as usual on her couch after dinner the grandmother sat down beside her for a few minutes and closed her eyes then she got up again as lively as ever and trotted off into the diningroom
no one was there
she is asleep i suppose she said to herself and then going up to fraulein rottenmeiers room she gave a loud knock at the door
she waited a few minutes and then fraulein rottenmeier opened the door and drew back in surprise at this unexpected visit
where is the child and what is she doing all this time
that is what i came to ask said frau sesemann
she is sitting in her room where she could well employ herself if she had the least idea of making herself useful but you have no idea frau sesemann of the outoftheway things this child imagines and does things which i could hardly repeat in good society
i should do the same if i had to sit in there like that child i can tell you i doubt if you would then like to repeat what i did in good society
go and fetch the child and bring her to my room i have some pretty books with me that i should like to give her
that is just the misfortune said fraulein rottenmeier with a despairing gesture what use are books to her
she has not been able to learn her a b c even all the long time she has been here it is quite impossible to get the least idea of it into her head and that the tutor himself will tell you if he had not the patience of an angel he would have given up teaching her long ago
that is very strange said frau sesemann she does not look to me like a child who would be unable to learn her alphabet
however bring her now to me she can at least amuse herself with the pictures in the books
fraulein rottenmeier was prepared with some further remarks but the grandmother had turned away and gone quickly towards her own room
she was surprised at what she had been told about heidis incapacity for learning and determined to find out more concerning this matter not by inquiries from the tutor however although she esteemed him highly for his uprightness of character she had always a friendly greeting for him but always avoided being drawn into conversation with him for she found his style of talk somewhat wearisome
heidi now appeared and gazed with openeyed delight and wonder at the beautiful colored pictures in the books which the grandmother gave her to look at
all of a sudden as the latter turned over one of the pages to a fresh picture the child gave a cry
for a moment or two she looked at it with brightening eyes then the tears began to fall and at last she burst into sobs
the grandmother looked at the pictureit represented a green pasture full of young animals some grazing and others nibbling at the shrubs
in the middle was a shepherd leaning upon his staff and looking on at his happy flock
the whole scene was bathed in golden light for the sun was just sinking below the horizon
the grandmother laid her hand kindly on heidis
dont cry dear child dont cry she said the picture has reminded you perhaps of something
but see there is a beautiful tale to the picture which i will tell you this evening
and there are other nice tales of all kinds to read and to tell again
but now we must have a little talk together so dry your tears and come and stand in front of me so that i may see you wellthere now we are happy again
but it was some little time before heidi could overcome her sobs
the grandmother gave her time to recover herself saying cheering words to her now and then there its all right now and we are quite happy again
when at last she saw that heidi was growing calmer she said now i want you to tell me something
how are you getting on in your schooltime do you like your lessons and have you learnt a great deal
o no
replied heidi sighing but i knew beforehand that it was not possible to learn
what is it you think impossible to learn
why to read it is too difficult
you dont say so
and who told you that
peter told me and he knew all about it for he had tried and tried and could not learn it
peter must be a very odd boy then
but listen heidi we must not always go by what peter says we must try for ourselves
i am certain that you did not give all your attention to the tutor when he was trying to teach you your letters
its of no use said heidi in the tone of one who was ready to endure what could not be cured
listen to what i have to say continued the grandmother
you have not been able to learn your alphabet because you believed what peter said but now you must believe what i tell youand i tell you that you can learn to read in a very little while as many other children do who are made like you and not like peter
and now hear what comes afteryou see that picture with the shepherd and the animalswell as soon as you are able to read you shall have that book for your own and then you will know all about the sheep and the goats and what the shepherd did and the wonderful things that happened to him just as if some one were telling you the whole tale
you will like to hear about all that wont you
heidi had listened with eager attention to the grandmothers words and now with a sigh exclaimed oh if only i could read now
it wont take you long now to learn that i can see and now we must go down to clara bring the books with you
and hand in hand the two returned to the study
since the day when heidi had so longed to go home and fraulein rottenmeier had met her and scolded her on the steps and told her how wicked and ungrateful she was to try and run away and what a good thing it was that herr sesemann knew nothing about it a change had come over the child
she had at last understood that day that she could not go home when she wished as dete had told her but that she would have to stay on in frankfurt for a long long time perhaps for ever
she had also understood that herr sesemann would think it ungrateful of her if she wished to leave and she believed that the grandmother and clara would think the same
so there was nobody to whom she dared confide her longing to go home for she would not for the world have given the grandmother who was so kind to her any reason for being as angry with her as fraulein rottenmeier had been
but the weight of trouble on the little heart grew heavier and heavier she could no longer eat her food and every day she grew a little paler
she lay awake for long hours at night for as soon as she was alone and everything was still around her the picture of the mountain with its sunshine and flowers rose vividly before her eyes and when at last she fell asleep it was to dream of the rocks and the snowfield turning crimson in the evening light and waking in the morning she would think herself back at the hut and prepare to run joyfully out intothe sunand then there was her large bed and here she was in frankfurt far far away from home
and heidi would often lay her face down on the pillow and weep long and quietly so that no one might hear her
heidis unhappiness did not escape the grandmothers notice
she let some days go by to see if the child grew brighter and lost her downcast appearance
but as matters did not mend and she saw that many mornings heidi had evidently been crying before she came downstairs she took her again into her room one day and drawing the child to her said now tell me heidi what is the matter are you in trouble
but heidi afraid if she told the truth that the grandmother would think her ungrateful and would then leave off being so kind to her answered cant tell you
well could you tell clara about it
oh no i cannot tell any one said heidi in so positive a tone and with a look of such trouble on her face that the grandmother felt full of pity for the child
then dear child let me tell you what to do you know that when we are in great trouble and cannot speak about it to anybody we must turn to god and pray him to help for he can deliver us from every care that oppresses us
you understand that do you not
you say your prayers every evening to the dear god in heaven and thank him for all he has done for you and pray him to keep you from all evil do you not
no i never say any prayers answered heidi
have you never been taught to pray heidi do you not know even what it means
i used to say prayers with the first grandmother but that is a long time ago and i have forgotten them
that is the reason heidi that you are so unhappy because you know no one who can help you
think what a comfort it is when the heart is heavy with grief to be able at any moment to go and tell everything to god and pray him for the help that no one else can give us
and he can help us and give us everything that will make us happy again
a sudden gleam of joy came into heidis eyes
may i tell him everything everything
yes everything heidi everything
heidi drew her hand away which the grandmother was holding affectionately between her own and said quickly may i go
yes of course was the answer and heidi ran out of the room into her own and sitting herself on a stool folded her hands together and told god about everything that was making her so sad and unhappy and begged him earnestly to help her and to let her go home to her grandfather
it was about a week after this that the tutor asked frau sesemanns permission for an interview with her as he wished to inform her of a remarkable thing that had come to pass
so she invited him to her room and as he entered she held out her hand in greeting and pushing a chair towards him i am pleased to see you she said pray sit down and tell me what brings you here nothing bad no complaints i hope
quite the reverse began the tutor
something has happened that i had given up hoping for and which no one knowing what has gone before could have guessed for according to all expectations that which has taken place could only be looked upon as a miracle and yet it really has come to pass and in the most extraordinary manner quite contrary to all that one could anticipate has the child heidi really learnt to read at last
put in frau sesemann
the tutor looked at the lady in speechless astonishment
at last he spoke again
it is indeed truly marvellous not only because she never seemed able to learn her a b c even after all my full explanations and after spending unusual pains upon her but because now she has learnt it so rapidly just after i had made up my mind to make no further attempts at the impossible but to put the letters as they were before her without any dissertation on their origin and meaning and now she has as you might say learnt her letters over night and started at once to read correctly quite unlike most beginners
and it is almost as astonishing to me that you should have guessed such an unlikely thing
many unlikely things happen in life said frau sesemann with a pleased smile
two things coming together may produce a happy result as for instance a fresh zeal for learning and a new method of teaching and neither does any harm
we can but rejoice that the child has made such a good start and hope for her future progress
after parting with the tutor she went down to the study to make sure of the good news
there sure enough was heidi sitting beside clara and reading aloud to her evidently herself very much surprised and growing more and more delighted with the new world that was now open to her as the black letters grew alive and turned into men and things and exciting stories
that same evening heidi found the large book with the beautiful pictures lying on her plate when she took her place at table and when she looked questioningly at the grandmother the latter nodded kindly to her and said yes its yours now
mine to keep always
even when i go home
said heidi blushing with pleasure
yes of course yours for ever the grandmother assured her
tomorrow we will begin to read it
but you are not going home yet heidi not for years put in clara
when grandmother goes away i shall want you to stay on with me
when heidi went to her room that night she had another look at her book before going to bed and from that day forth her chief pleasure was to read the tales which belonged to the beautiful pictures over and over again
if the grandmother said as they were sitting together in the evening now heidi will read aloud to us heidi was delighted for reading was no trouble to her now and when she read the tales aloud the scenes seemed to grow more beautiful and distinct and then grandmother would explain and tell her more about them still
still the picture she liked best was the one of the shepherd leaning on his staff with his flock around him in the midst of the green pasture for he was now at home and happy following his fathers sheep and goats
then came the picture where he was seen far away from his fathers house obliged to look after the swine and he had grown pale and thin from the husks which were all he had to eat
even the sun seemed here to be less bright and everything looked grey and misty
but there was the third picture still to this tale here was the old father with outstretched arms running to meet and embrace his returning and repentant son who was advancing timidly worn out and emaciated and clad in a ragged coat
that was heidis favorite tale which she read over and over again aloud and to herself and she was never tired of hearing the grandmother explain it to her and clara
but there were other tales in the book besides and what with reading and looking at the pictures the days passed quickly away and the time drew near for the grandmother to return home
heidi gains in one way and loses in another every afternoon during her visit the grandmother went and sat down for a few minutes beside clara after dinner when the latter was resting and fraulein rottenmeier probably for the same reason had disappeared inside her room but five minutes sufficed her and then she was up again and heidi was sent for to her room and there she would talk to the child and employ and amuse her in all sorts of ways
the grandmother had a lot of pretty dolls and she showed heidi how to make dresses and pinafores for them so that heidi learnt how to sew and to make all sorts of beautiful clothes for the little people out of a wonderful collection of pieces that grandmother had by her of every describable and lovely color
and then grandmother liked to hear her read aloud and the oftener heidi read her tales the fonder she grew of them
she entered into the lives of all the people she read about so that they became like dear friends to her and it delighted her more and more to be with them
but still heidi never looked really happy and her bright eyes were no longer to be seen
it was the last week of the grandmothers visit
she called heidi into her room as usual one day after dinner and the child came with her book under her arm
the grandmother called her to come close and then laying the book aside said now child tell me why you are not happy
have you still the same trouble at heart
heidi nodded in reply
have you told god about it
yes
and do you pray every day that he will make things right and that you may be happy again
no i have left off praying
do not tell me that heidi
why have you left off praying
it is of no use god does not listen heidi went on in an agitated voice and i can understand that when there are so many many people in frankfurt praying to him every evening that he cannot attend to them all and he certainly has not heard what i said to him
and why are you so sure of that heidi
because i have prayed for the same thing every day for weeks and yet god has not done what i asked
you are wrong heidi you must not think of him like that
god is a good father to us all and knows better than we do what is good for us
if we ask him for something that is not good for us he does not give it but something better still if only we will continue to pray earnestly and do not run away and lose our trust in him
god did not think what you have been praying for was good for you just now but be sure he heard you for he can hear and see every one at the same time because he is a god and not a human being like you and me
and because he thought it was better for you not to have at once what you wanted he said to himself yes heidi shall have what she asks for but not until the right time comes so that she may be quite happy
if i do what she wants now and then one day she sees that it would have been better for her not to have had her own way she will cry and say if only god had not given me what i asked for
it is not so good as i expected
and while god is watching over you and looking to see if you will trust him and go on praying to him every day and turn to him for everything you want you run away and leave off saying your prayers and forget all about him
and when god no longer hears the voice of one he knew among those who pray to him he lets that person go his own way that he may learn how foolish he is
and then this one gets into trouble and cries save me god for there is none other to help me and god says why did you go from me i could not help you when you ran away
and you would not like to grieve god would you heidi when he only wants to be kind to you
so will you not go and ask him to forgive you and continue to pray and to trust him for you may be sure that he will make everything right and happy for you and then you will be glad and lighthearted again
heidi had perfect confidence in the grandmother and every word she said sunk into her heart
i will go at once and ask god to forgive me and i will never forget him again she replied repentantly
that is right dear child and anxious to cheer her added dont be unhappy for he will do everything you wish in good time
and heidi ran away and prayed that she might always remember god and that he would go on thinking about her
the day came for grandmothers departurea sad one for clara and heidi
but the grandmother was determined to make it as much like a holiday as possible and not to let them mope and she kept them so lively and amused that they had no time to think about their sorrow at her going until she really drove away
then the house seemed so silent and empty that heidi and clara did not know what to do with themselves and sat during the remainder of the day like two lost children
the next day when the hour came for clara and heidi to be together the latter walked in with her book and proposed that she should go on reading aloud every afternoon to clara if the latter liked it
clara agreed and thought anyhow it would be nice for that day so heidi began with her usual enthusiasm
but the reading did not last long for heidi had hardly begun a tale about a dying grandmother before she cried out o
then grandmother is dead
and burst into tears for everything she read was so real to her that she quite thought it was the grandmother at home who had died and she kept on exclaiming as her sobs increased she is dead and i shall never see her again and she never had one of the white rolls
clara did all she could to explain to heidi that the story was about quite a different grandmother but even when at last she had been able to convince heidi of this the latter continued to weep inconsolably for now she had awakened to the thought that perhaps the grandmother and even the grandfather also might die while she was so far away and that if she did not go home for a long time she would find everything there all silent and dead and there she would be all alone and would never be able to see the dear ones she loved any more
fraulein rottenmeier had meanwhile come into the room and clara explained to her what had happened
as heidi continued her weeping the lady who was evidently getting impatient with her went up to heidi and said with decision now adelaide that is enough of all this causeless lamentation
i will tell you once for all if there are any more scenes like this while you are reading i shall take the book away from you and shall not let you have it again
her words had immediate effect on heidi who turned pale with fear
the book was her one great treasure
she quickly dried her tears and swallowed her sobs as best she could so that no further sound of them should be heard
the threat did its work for heidi never cried aloud again whatever she might be reading but she had often to struggle hard to keep back her tears so that clara would look at her and say what faces you are making heidi i never saw anything like it
but the faces made no noise and did not offend fraulein rottenmeier and heidi having overcome her fit of despairing misery would go quietly on for a while and no one perceived her sorrow
but she lost all her appetite and looked so pale and thin that sebastian was quite unhappy when he looked at her and could not bear to see her refusing all the nice dishes he handed her
he would whisper to her sometimes in quite a kind fatherly manner take a little you dont know how nice it is
there a good spoonful now another
but it was of no use heidi hardly ate anything at all and as soon as she laid her head down at night the picture of home would rise before her eyes and she would weep burying her face in the pillow that her crying might not be heard
and so many weeks passed away
heidi did not know it is was winter or summer for the walls and windows she looked out upon showed no change and she never went beyond the house except on rare occasions when clara was well enough to drive out and then they only went a very little way as clara could not bear the movement for long
so that on these occasions they generally only saw more fine streets and large houses and crowds of people they seldom got anywhere beyond them and grass and flowers fir trees and mountains were still far away
heidis longing for the old familiar and beautiful things grew daily stronger so that now only to read a word that recalled them to her remembrance brought her to the verge of tears which with difficulty she suppressed
so the autumn and winter passed and again the sun came shining down on the white walls of the opposite houses and heidi would think to herself that now the time had come for peter to go out again with the goats to where the golden flowers of the cistus were glowing in the sunlight and all the rocks around turned to fire at sunset
heidi would go and sit in a corner of her lonely room and put her hands up to her eyes that she might not see the sun shining on the opposite wall and then she would remain without moving battling silently with her terrible homesickness until clara sent for her again
a ghost in the house for some days past fraulein rottenmeier had gone about rather silently and as if lost in thought
as twilight fell and she passed from room to room or along the long corridors she was seen to look cautiously behind her and into the dark corners as if she thought some one was coming silently behind her and might unexpectedly give her dress a pull
nor would she now go alone into some parts of the house
if she visited the upper floor where the grand guestchambers were or had to go down into the large mysterious councilchamber where every footstep echoed and the old senators with their big white collars looked down so solemnly and immovably from their frames she regularly called tinette to accompany her in case as she said there might be something to carry up or down
tinette on her side did exactly the same if she had business upstairs or down she called sebastian to accompany her and there was always something he must help her with which she could not carry alone
more curious still sebastian also if sent into one of the more distant rooms always called john to go with him in case he should want his assistance in bringing what was required
and john readily obeyed although there was never anything to carry and either might well have gone alone but he did not know how soon he might want to ask sebastian to do the same service for him
and while these things were going on upstairs the cook who had been in the house for years would stand shaking her head over her pots and kettles and sighing that ever i should live to know such a thing
for something very strange and mysterious was going on in herr sesemanns house
every morning when the servants went downstairs they found the front door wide open although nobody could be seen far or near to account for it
during the first few days that this happened every room and corner was searched in great alarm to see if anything had been stolen for the general idea was that a thief had been hiding in the house and had gone off in the night with the stolen goods but not a thing in the house had been touched everything was safe in its place
the door was doubly locked at night and for further security the wooden bar was fastened across it but it was no goodnext morning the door again stood open
the servants in their fear and excitement got up extra early but not so early but what the door had been opened before they got downstairs although everything and everybody around were still wrapped in slumber and the doors and windows of the adjoining houses all fast shut
at last after a great deal of persuasion from fraulein rottenmeier sebastian and john plucked up courage and agreed to sit up one night in the room next to the large councilchamber and to watch and see what would happen
fraulein rottenmeier looked up several weapons belonging to the master and gave these and a bottle of spirits to sebastian so that their courage might not faint if it came to a fight
on the appointed night the two sat down and began at once to take some of the strengthening cordial which at first made them very talkative and then very sleepy so that they leant back in their seats and became silent
as midnight struck sebastian roused himself and called to his companion who however was not easy to wake and kept rolling his head first to one side and then the other and continuing to sleep
sebastian began to listen more attentively for he was wide awake now
everything was still as a mouse all sound had died away from the streets even
he did not feel inclined to go to sleep again for the stillness was ghostly to him and he was afraid now to raise his voice to rouse john so he shook him gently to make him stir
at last as one struck john work up and came back to the consciousness of why he was sitting in a chair instead of lying in his bed
he now got up with a great show of courage and said come sebastian we must go outside and see what is going on you need not be afraid just follow me
whereupon he opened the door wide and stepped into the hall
just as he did so a sudden gust of air blew through the open front door and put out the light which john held in his hand
he started back almost overturning sebastian whom he clutched and pulled back into the room and then shutting the door quickly he turned the key as far as he could make it go
then he pulled out his matches and lighted his candle again
sebastian in the suddenness of the affair did not know exactly what had happened for he had not seen the open door or felt the breeze behind johns broad figure
but now as he saw the latter in the light he gave a cry of alarm for john was trembling all over and as white as a ghost
whats the matter
what did you see outside
asked sebastian sympathetically
the door partly open gasped john and a white figure standing at the top of the stepsthere it stood and then all in a minute it disappeared
sebastian felt his blood run cold
the two sat down close to one another and did not dare move again till the morning broke and the streets began to be alive again
then they left the room together shut the front door and went upstairs to tell fraulein rottenmeier of their experience
she was quite ready to receive them for she had not been able to sleep at all in the anxiety of waiting to hear their report
they had no sooner given her details of the nights experience than she sat down and wrote straight off to herr sesemann who had never received such a letter before in his life
she could hardly write she told him for her fingers were stiff with fear and herr sesemann must please arrange to come back at once for dreadful and unaccountable things were taking place at home
then she entered into particulars of all that had happened of how the door was found standing open every morning and how nobody in the house now felt sure of their life in this unprotected state of things and how it was impossible to tell what terrible results might follow on these mysterious doings
herr sesemann answered that it was quite impossible for him to arrange to leave his business and return home at once
he was very much astonished at this ghost tale but hoped by this time the ghost had disappeared
if however it still continued to disturb the household would fraulein rottenmeier write to the grandmother and ask her if she could come and do something she he was sure would soon find out a way to deal with the ghost so that it would not venture again to haunt his house
fraulein rottenmeier was not pleased with the tone of this letter she did not think the matter was treated seriously enough
she wrote off without delay to frau sesemann but got no more satisfactory reply from that quarter and some remarks in the letter she considered were quite offensive
frau sesemann wrote that she did not feel inclined to take the journey again from holstein to frankfurt because rottenmeier fancied she saw ghosts
there had never been a ghost in the house since she had known it and if there was one now it must be a live one with which rottenmeier ought to be able to deal if not she had better send for the watchman to help her
fraulein rottenmeier however was determined not to pass any more days in a state of fear and she knew the right course to pursue
she had as yet said nothing to the children of the ghostly apparitions for she knew if she did that the children would not remain alone for a single moment and that might entail discomfort for herself
but now she walked straight off into the study and there in a low mysterious voice told the two children everything that had taken place
clara immediately screamed out that she could not remain another minute alone her father must come home and fraulein rottenmeier must sleep in her room at night and heidi too must not be left by herself for the ghost might do something to her
she insisted that they should all sleep together in one room and keep a light burning all night and tinette had better be in the next room and sebastian and john come upstairs and spend the night in the hall so that they might call out and frighten the ghost the instant they saw it appear on the steps
clara in short grew very excited and fraulein rottenmeier had great difficulty in quieting her
she promised to write at once to her father and to have her bed put in her room and not to be left alone for a moment
they could not all sleep in the same room but if heidi was frightened why tinette must go into her room
but heidi was far more frightened of tinette than of ghosts of which the child had never before heard so she assured the others she did not mind the ghost and would rather be alone at night
fraulein rottenmeier now sat down to write another letter to herr sesemann stating that these unaccountable things that were going on in the house had so affected his daughters delicate constitution that the worst consequences might be expected
epileptic fits and st
vituss dance often came on suddenly in cases like this and clara was liable to be attacked by either if the cause of the general alarm was not removed
the letter was successful and two days later herr sesemann stood at his front door and rang the bell in such a manner that everybody came rushing from all parts of the house and stood looking affrighted at everybody else convinced that the ghost was impudently beginning its evil tricks in daylight
sebastian peeped cautiously through a halfclosed shutter as he did so there came another violent ring at the bell which it was impossible to mistake for anything but a very hard pull from a nonghostly hand
and sebastian recognised whose hand it was and rushing pellmell out of the room fell heels over head downstairs but picked himself up at the bottom and flung open the street door
herr sesemann greeted him abruptly and went up without a moments delay into his daughters room
clara greeted him with a cry of joy and seeing her so lively and apparently as well as ever his face cleared and the frown of anxiety passed gradually away from it as he heard from his daughters own lips that she had nothing the matter with her and moreover was so delighted to see him that she was quite glad about the ghost as it was the cause of bringing him home again
and how is the ghost getting on
he asked turning to fraulein rottenmeier with a twinkle of amusement in his eye
it is no joke i assure you replied that lady
you will not laugh yourself tomorrow morning herr sesemann what is going on in the house points to some terrible thing that has taken place in the past and been concealed
well i know nothing about that said the master of the house but i must beg you not to bring suspicion on my worthy ancestors
and now will you kindly call sebastian into the dining room as i wish to speak to him alone
herr sesemann had been quite aware that sebastian and fraulein rottenmeier were not on the best of terms and he had his ideas about this scare
come here lad he said as sebastian appeared and tell me franklyhave you been playing at ghosts to amuse yourself at fraulein rottenmeiers expense
no on my honor sir pray do not think it i am very uncomfortable about the matter myself answered sebastian with unmistakable truthfulness
well if that is so i will show you and john tomorrow morning how ghosts look in the daylight
you ought to be ashamed of yourself sebastian a great strong lad like you to run away from a ghost
but now go and take a message to my old friend the doctor give him my kind regards and ask him if he will come to me tonight at nine oclock without fail i have come by express from paris to consult him
i shall want him to spend the night here so bad a case is it so he will arrange accordingly
you understand
yes sir replied sebastian i will see to the matter as you wish
then herr sesemann returned to clara and begged her to have no more fear as he would soon find out all about the ghost and put an end to it
punctually at nine oclock after the children had gone to bed and fraulein rottenmeier had retired the doctor arrived
he was a greyhaired man with a fresh face and two bright kindly eyes
he looked anxious as he walked in but on catching sight of his patient burst out laughing and clapped him on the shoulder
well he said you look pretty bad for a person that i am to sit up with all night
patience friend answered herr sesemann the one you have to sit up for will look a good deal worse when we have once caught him
so there is a sick person in the house and one that has first to be caught
much worse than that doctor
a ghost in the house
my house is haunted
the doctor laughed aloud
thats a nice way of showing sympathy doctor
continued herr sesemann
its a pity my friend rottenmeier cannot hear you
she is firmly convinced that some old member of the family is wandering about the house doing penance for some awful crime he committed
how did she become acquainted with him
asked the doctor still very much amused
so herr sesemann recounted to him how the front door was nightly opened by somebody according to the testimony of the combined household and he had therefore provided two loaded revolvers so as to be prepared for anything that happened for either the whole thing was a joke got up by some friend of the servants just to alarm the household while he was awayand in that case a pistol fired into the air would procure him a wholesome fright or else it was a thief who by leading everybody at first to think there was a ghost made it safe for himself when he came later to steal as no one would venture to run out if they heard him and in that case too a good weapon would not be amiss
the two took up their quarters for the night in the same room in which sebastian and john had kept watch
a bottle of wine was placed on the table for a little refreshment would be welcome from time to time if the night was to be passed sitting up
beside it lay the two revolvers and two goodsized candles had also been lighted for herr sesemann was determined not to wait for ghosts in any half light
the door was shut close to prevent the light being seen in the hall outside which might frighten away the ghost
and now the two gentlemen sat comfortably back in the armchairs and began talking of all sorts of things now and then pausing to take a good draught of wine and so twelve oclock struck before they were aware
the ghost has got scent of us and is keeping away tonight said the doctor
wait a bit it does not generally appear before one oclock answered his friend
they started talking again
one oclock struck
there was not a sound about the house nor in the street outside
suddenly the doctor lifted his finger
hush
sesemann dont you hear something
they both listened and they distinctly heard the bar softly pushed aside and then the key turned in the lock and the door opened
herr sesemann put out his hand for his revolver
you are not afraid are you
said the doctor as he stood up
it is better to take precautions whispered herr sesemann and seizing one of the lights in his other hand he followed the doctor who armed in like manner with a light and a revolver went softly on in front
they stepped into the hall
the moonlight was shining in through the open door and fell on a white figure standing motionless in the doorway
who is there
thundered the doctor in a voice that echoed through the hall as the two men advanced with lights and weapons towards the figure
it turned and gave a low cry
there in her little white nightgown stood heidi with bare feet staring with wild eyes at the lights and the revolvers and trembling from head to foot like a leaf in the wind
the two men looked as one another in surprise
why i believe it is your little watercarrier sesemann said the doctor
child what does this mean
said herr sesemann
what did you want
why did you come down here
white with terror and hardly able to make her voice heard heidi answered i dont know
but now the doctor stepped forward
this is a matter for me to see to sesemann go back to your chair
i must take the child upstairs to her bed
and with that he put down his revolver and gently taking the child by the hand led her upstairs
dont be frightened he said as they went up side by side its nothing to be frightened about its all right only just go quietly
on reaching heidis room the doctor put the candle down on the table and taking heidi up in his arms laid her on the bed and carefully covered her over
then he sat down beside her and waited until heidi had grown quieter and no longer trembled so violently
he took her hand and said in a kind soothing voice there now you feel better and now tell me where you were wanting to go to
i did not want to go anywhere said heidi
i did not know i went downstairs but all at once i was there
i see and had you been dreaming so that you seemed to see and hear something very distinctly
yes i dream every night and always about the same things
i think i am back with the grandfather and i hear the sound in the fir trees outside and i see the stars shining so brightly and then i open the door quickly and run out and it is all so beautiful
but when i wake i am still in frankfurt
and heidi struggled as she spoke to keep back the sobs which seemed to choke her
and have you no pain anywhere
no pain in your head or back
no only a feeling as if there were a great stone weighing on me here
as if you had eaten something that would not go down
no not like that something heavy as if i wanted to cry very much
i see and then do you have a good cry
oh no i mustnt fraulein rottenmeier forbade me to cry
so you swallow it all down i suppose
are you happy here in frankfurt
yes was the low answer but it sounded more like no
and where did you live with your grandfather
up on the mountain
that wasnt very amusing rather dull at times eh
no no it was beautiful beautiful
heidi could go no further the remembrance of the past the excitement she had just gone through the long suppressed weeping were too much for the childs strength the tears began to fall fast and she broke into violent weeping
the doctor stood up and laid her head kindly down on the pillow
there there go on crying it will do you good and then go to sleep it will be all right tomorrow
then he left the room and went downstairs to herr sesemann when he was once more sitting in the armchair opposite his friend sesemann he said let me first tell you that your little charge is a sleepwalker she is the ghost who has nightly opened the front door and put your household into this fever of alarm
secondly the child is consumed with homesickness to such an extent that she is nearly a skeleton already and soon will be quite one something must be done at once
for the first trouble due to her overexcited nerves there is but one remedy to send her back to her native mountain air and for the second trouble there is also but one cure and that the same
so to morrow the child must start for home there you have my prescription
herr sesemann had arisen and now paced up and down the room in the greatest state of concern
he exclaimed the child a sleepwalker and ill
home sick and grown emaciated in my house
all this has taken place in my house and no one seen or known anything about it
and you mean doctor that the child who came here happy and healthy i am to send back to her grandfather a miserable little skeleton
i cant do it you cannot dream of my doing such a thing
take the child in hand do with her what you will and make her whole and sound and then she shall go home but you must do something first
sesemann replied the doctor consider what you are doing
this illness of the childs is not one to be cured with pills and powders
the child has not a tough constitution but if you send her back at once she may recover in the mountain air if notyou would rather she went back ill than not at all
herr sesemann stood still the doctors words were a shock to him
if you put it so doctor there is assuredly only one wayand the thing must be seen to at once
and then he and the doctor walked up and down for a while arranging what to do after which the doctor said goodbye for some time had passed since they first sat down together and as the master himself opened the hall door this time the morning light shone down through it into the house
a summer evening on the mountain herr sesemann a good deal irritated and excited went quickly upstairs and along the passage to fraulein rottenmeiers room and there gave such an unusually loud knock at the door that the lady awoke from sleep with a cry of alarm
she heard the master of the house calling to her from the other side of the door please make haste and come down to me in the diningroom we must make ready for a journey at once
fraulein rottenmeier looked at her clock it was just halfpast four she had never got up so early before in her life
what could have happened
what with her curiosity and excitement she took hold of everything the wrong way and it was a case with her of more haste less speed for she kept on searching everywhere for garments which she had already put on
meanwhile herr sesemann had gone on farther and rung the bells in turn which communicated with the several servants rooms causing frightened figures to leap out of bed convinced that the ghost had attacked the master and that he was calling for help
one by one they made their appearance in the diningroom each with a more terrified face than the last and were astonished to see their master walking up and down looking well and cheerful and with no appearance of having had an encounter with a ghost
john was sent off without delay to get the horses and carriage ready tinette was ordered to wake heidi and get her dressed for a journey sebastian was hurried off to the house where dete was in service to bring the latter round
then fraulein rottenmeier having at last accomplished her toilet came down with everything well adjusted about her except her cap which was put on hind side before
herr sesemann put down her flurried appearance to the early awakening he had caused her and began without delay to give her directions
she was to get out a trunk at once and pack up all the things belonging to the swiss child for so he usually spoke of heidi being unaccustomed to her name and a good part of claras clothes as well so that the child might take home proper apparel but everything was to be done immediately as there was no time for consideration
fraulein rottenmeier stood as if rooted to the spot and stared in astonishment at herr sesemann
she had quite expected a long and private account of some terrible ghostly experience of his during the night which she would have enjoyed hearing about in the broad daylight
instead of this there were these prosaic and troublesome directions which were so unexpected that she took some time to get over her surprise and disappointment and continued standing awaiting further explanation
but herr sesemann had no thought or time for explanations and left her standing there while he went to speak to clara
as he anticipated the unusual commotion in the house had disturbed her and she was lying and listening and wondering what had happened
so he sat down and told her everything that had occurred during the past night and explained that the doctor had given his verdict and pronounced heidi to be in a very highly strung state so that her nightly wanderings might gradually lead her farther and farther perhaps even on to the roof which of course would be very dangerous for her
and so they had decided to send her home at once as he did not like to take the responsibility of her remaining and clara would see for herself that it was the only thing to do
clara was very much distressed and at first made all kinds of suggestions for keeping heidi with her but her father was firm and promised her if she would be reasonable and make no further fuss that he would take her to switzerland next summer
so clara gave in to the inevitable only stipulating that the box might be brought into her room to be packed so that she might add whatever she liked and her father was only too pleased to let her provide a nice outfit for the child
meanwhile dete had arrived and was waiting in the hall wondering what extraordinary event had come to pass for her to be sent for at such an unusual hour
herr sesemann informed her of the state heidi was in and that he wished her that very day to take her home
dete was greatly disappointed for she had not expected such a piece of news
she remembered uncles last words that he never wished to set eyes on her again and it seemed to her that to take back the child to him after having left it with him once and then taken it away again was not a safe or wise thing for her to do
so she excused herself to herr sesemann with her usual flow of words today and tomorrow it would be quite impossible for her to take the journey and there was so much to do that she doubted if she could get off on any of the following days
herr sesemann understood that she was unwilling to go at all and so dismissed her
then he sent for sebastian and told him to make ready to start he was to travel with the child as far as basle that day and the next day take her home
he would give him a letter to carry to the grandfather which would explain everything and he himself could come back by return
but there is one thing in particular which i wish you to look after said herr sesemann in conclusion and be sure you attend to what i say
i know the people of this hotel in basle the name of which i give you on this card
they will see to providing rooms for the child and you
when there go at once into the childs room and see that the windows are all firmly fastened so that they cannot be easily opened
after the child is in bed lock the door of her room on the outside for the child walks in her sleep and might run into danger in a strange house if she went wandering downstairs and tried to open the front door so you understand
then that was it
exclaimed sebastian for now a light was thrown on the ghostly visitations
yes that was it
and you are a coward and you may tell john he is the same and the whole household a pack of idiots
and with this herr sesemann went off to his study to write a letter to almuncle
sebastian remained standing feeling rather foolish
if only i had not let that fool of a john drag me back into the room and had gone after the little white figure which i should do certainly if i saw it now
he kept on saying to himself but just now every corner of the room was clearly visible in the daylight
meanwhile heidi was standing expectantly dressed in her sunday frock waiting to see what would happen next for tinette had only woke her up with a shake and put on her clothes without a word of explanation
the little uneducated child was far too much beneath her for tinette to speak to
herr sesemann went back to the diningroom with the letter breakfast was now ready and he asked where is the child
heidi was fetched and as she walked up to him to say good morning he looked inquiringly into her face and said well what do you say to this little one
heidi looked at him in perplexity
why you dont know anything about it i see laughed herr sesemann
you are going home today going at once
home murmured heidi in a low voice turning pale she was so overcome that for a moment or two she could hardly breathe
dont you want to hear more about it
oh yes yes
exclaimed heidi her face now rosy with delight
all right then said herr sesemann as he sat down and made her a sign to do the same but now make a good breakfast and then off you go in the carriage
but heidi could not swallow a morsel though she tried to do what she was told she was in such a state of excitement that she hardly knew if she was awake or dreaming or if she would again open her eyes to find herself in her nightgown at the front door
tell sebastian to take plenty of provisions with him herr sesemann called out to fraulein rottenmeier who just then came into the room the child cant eat anything now which is quite natural
now run up to clara and stay with her till the carriage comes round he added kindly turning to heidi
heidi had been longing for this and ran quickly upstairs
an immense trunk was standing open in the middle of the room
come along heidi cried clara as she entered see all the things i have had put in for youarent you pleased
and she ran over a list of things dresses and aprons and handkerchiefs and all kinds of working materials
and look here she added as she triumphantly held up a basket
heidi peeped in and jumped for joy for inside it were twelve beautiful round white rolls all for grandmother
in their delight the children forgot that the time had come for them to separate and when some one called out the carriage is here there was no time for grieving
heidi ran to her room to fetch her darling book she knew no one could have packed that as it lay under her pillow for heidi had kept it by her night and day
this was put in the basket with the rolls
then she opened her wardrobe to look for another treasure which perhaps no one would have thought of packingand she was rightthe old red shawl had been left behind fraulein rottenmeier not considering it worth putting in with the other things
heidi wrapped it round something else which she laid on the top of the basket so that the red package was quite conspicuous
then she put on her pretty hat and left the room
the children could not spend much time over their farewells for herr sesemann was waiting to put heidi in the carriage
fraulein rottenmeier was waiting at the top of the stairs to say goodbye to her
when she caught sight of the strange little red bundle she took it out of the basket and threw it on the ground
no no adelaide she exclaimed you cannot leave the house with that thing
what can you possibly want with it
and then she said goodbye to the child
heidi did not dare take up her little bundle but she gave the master of the house an imploring look as if her greatest treasure had been taken from her
no no said herr sesemann in a very decided voice the child shall take home with her whatever she likes kittens and tortoises if it pleases her we need not put ourselves out about that fraulein rottenmeier
heidi quickly picked up her bundle with a look of joy and gratitude
as she stood by the carriage door herr sesemann gave her his hand and said he hoped she would remember him and clara
he wished her a happy journey and heidi thanked him for all his kindness and added and please say goodbye to the doctor for me and give him many many thanks
for she had not forgotten that he had said to her the night before it will be all right tomorrow and she rightly divined that he had helped to make it so for her
heidi was now lifted into the carriage and then the basket and the provisions were put in and finally sebastian took his place
then herr sesemann called out once more a pleasant journey to you and the carriage rolled away
heidi was soon sitting in the railway carriage holding her basket tightly on her lap she would not let it out of her hands for a moment for it contained the delicious rolls for grandmother so she must keep it carefully and even peep inside it from time to time to enjoy the sight of them
for many hours she sat as still as a mouse only now was she beginning to realize that she was going home to the grandfather the mountain the grandmother and peter and pictures of all she was going to see again rose one by one before her eyes she thought of how everything would look at home but this brought other thoughts to her mind and all of a sudden she said anxiously sebastian are you sure that grandmother on the mountain is not dead
no no said sebastian wishing to soothe her we will hope not she is sure to be alive still
then heidi fell back on her own thoughts again
now and then she looked inside the basket for the thing she looked forward to most was laying all the rolls out on grandmothers table
after a long silence she spoke again if only we could know for certain that grandmother is alive
yes yes said sebastian half asleep she is sure to be alive there is no reason why she should be dead
after a while sleep fell on heidi too and after her disturbed night and early rising she slept so soundly that she did not wake till sebastian shook her by the arm and called to her wake up wake up
we shall have to get out directly we are just in basle
there was a further railway journey of many hours the next day
heidi again sat with her basket on her knee for she would not have given it up to sebastian on any consideration today she never even opened her mouth for her excitement which increased with every mile of the journey kept her speechless
all of a sudden before heidi expected it a voice called out mayenfeld
she and sebastian both jumped up the latter also taken by surprise
in another minute they were both standing on the platform with heidis trunk and the train was steaming away down the valley
sebastian looked after it regretfully for he preferred the easier mode of travelling to a wearisome climb on foot especially as there was danger no doubt as well as fatigue in a country like this where according to sebastians idea everything and everybody were half savage
he therefore looked cautiously to either side to see who was a likely person to ask the safest way to dorfli
just outside the station he saw a shabbylooking little cart and horse which a broadshouldered man was loading with heavy sacks that had been brought by the train so he went up to him and asked which was the safest way to get to dorfli
all the roads about here are safe was the curt reply
so sebastian altered his question and asked which was the best way to avoid falling over the precipice and also how a box could be conveyed to dorfli
the man looked at the box weighing it with his eye and then volunteered if it was not too heavy to take it on his own cart as he was driving to dorfli
after some little interchange of words it was finally agreed that the man should take both the child and the box to dorfli and there find some one who could be sent on with heidi up the mountain
i can go by myself i know the way well from dorfli put in heidi who had been listening attentively to the conversation
sebastian was greatly relieved at not having to do any mountain climbing
he drew heidi aside and gave her a thick rolled parcel and a letter for her grandfather the parcel he told her was a present from herr sesemann and she must put it at the bottom of her basket under the rolls and be very careful not to lose it as herr sesemann would be very vexed if she did and never be the same to her again so little miss was to think well of what he said
i shall be sure not to lose it said heidi confidently and she at once put the roll and the letter at the bottom of her basket
the trunk meanwhile had been hoisted into the cart and now sebastian lifted heidi and her basket on to the high seat and shook hands with her he then made signs to her to keep her eye on the basket for the driver was standing near and sebastian thought it better to be careful especially as he knew that he ought himself to have seen the child safely to her journeys end
the driver now swung himself up beside heidi and the cart rolled away in the direction of the mountains while sebastian glad of having no tiring and dangerous journey on foot before him sat down in the station and awaited the return train
the driver of the car was the miller at dorfli and was taking home his sacks of flour
he had never seen heidi but like everybody in dorfli knew all about her
he had known her parents and felt sure at once that this was the child of whom he had heard so much
he began to wonder why she had come back and as they drove along he entered into conversation with her
you are the child who lived with your grandfather almuncle are you not
didnt they treat you well down there that you have come back so soon
yes it was not that everything in frankfurt is as nice as it could be
then why are you running home again
only because herr sesemann gave me leave or else i should not have come
if they were willing to let you stay why did you not remain where you were better off than at home
because i would a thousand times rather be with grandfather on the mountain than anywhere else in the world
you will think differently perhaps when you get back there grumbled the miller and then to himself its strange of her for she must know what its like
he began whistling and said no more while heidi looked around her and began to tremble with excitement for she knew every tree along the way and there overhead were the high jagged peaks of the mountain looking down on her like old friends
and heidi nodded back to them and grew every moment more wild with her joy and longing feeling as if she must jump down from the cart and run with all her might till she reached the top
but she sat quite still and did not move although inwardly in such agitation
the clock was striking five as they drove into dorfli
a crowd of women and children immediately surrounded the cart for the box and the child arriving with the miller had excited the curiosity of everybody in the neighborhood inquisitive to know whence they came and whither they were going and to whom they belonged
as the miller lifted heidi down she said hastily thank you grandfather will send for the trunk and was just going to run off when first one and then another of the bystanders caught hold of her each one having a different question to put to her
but heidi pushed her way through them with such an expression of distress on her face that they were forced to let her go
you see they said to one another how frightened she is and no wonder and then they went on to talk of almuncle how much worse he had grown that last year never speaking a word and looking as if he would like to kill everybody he met and if the child had anywhere else to go to she certainly would not run back to the old dragons den
but here the miller interrupted them saying he knew more about it than they did and began telling them how a kind gentleman had brought her to mayenfeld and seen her off and had given him his fare without any bargaining and extra money for himself what was more the child had assured him that she had had everything she wanted where she had been and that it was her own wish to return to her grandfather
this information caused great surprise and was soon repeated all over dorfli and that evening there was not a house in the place in which the astounding news was not discussed of how heidi had of her own accord given up a luxurious home to return to her grandfather
heidi climbed up the steep path from dorfli as quickly as she could she was obliged however to pause now and again to take breath for the basket she carried was rather heavy and the way got steeper as she drew nearer the top
one thought alone filled heidis mind would she find the grandmother sitting in her usual corner by the spinningwheel was she still alive
at last heidi caught sight of the grandmothers house in the hollow of the mountain and her heart began to beat she ran faster and faster and her heart beat louder and louderand now she had reached the house but she trembled so she could hardly open the doorand then she was standing inside unable in her breathlessness to utter a sound
ah my god
cried a voice from the corner that was how heidi used to run in if only i could have her with me once again
its i i grandmother cried heidi as she ran and flung herself on her knees beside the old woman and seizing her hands clung to her unable to speak for joy
and the grandmother herself could not say a word for some time so unexpected was this happiness but at last she put out her hand and stroked heidis curly hair and said yes yes that is her hair and her voice thank god that he has granted my prayer
and tears of joy fell from the blind eyes on to heidis hand
is it really you heidi have you really come back to me
yes grandmother i am really here answered heidi in a reassuring voice
do not cry for i have really come back and i am never going away again and i shall come every day to see you and you wont have any more hard bread to eat for some days for look look
and heidi took the rolls from the basket and piled the whole twelve up on grandmothers lap
ah child
child
what a blessing you bring with you
the old woman exclaimed as she felt and seemed never to come to the end of the rolls
but you yourself are the greatest blessing heidi and again she touched the childs hair and passed her hand over her hot cheeks and said say something child that i may hear your voice
then heidi told her how unhappy she had been thinking that the grandmother might die while she was away and would never have her white rolls and that then she would never never see her again
peters mother now came in and stood for a moment overcome with astonishment
why its heidi she exclaimed and yet can it be
heidi stood up and brigitta now could not say enough in her admiration of the childs dress and appearance she walked round her exclaiming all the while grandmother if you could only see her and see what a pretty frock she has on you would hardly know her again
and the hat with the feather in it is yours too i suppose
put it on that i may see how you look in it
no i would rather not replied heidi firmly
you can have it if you like i do not want it i have my own still
and heidi so saying undid her red bundle and took out her own old hat which had become a little more battered still during the journey
but this was no trouble to heidi she had not forgotten how her grandfather had called out to dete that he never wished to see her and her hat and feathers again and this was the reason she had so anxiously preserved her old hat for she had never ceased to think about going home to her grandfather
but brigitta told her not to be so foolish as to give it away she would not think of taking such a beautiful hat if heidi did not want to wear it she might sell it to the schoolmasters daughter in dorfli and get a good deal of money for it
but heidi stuck to her intention and hid the hat quietly in a corner behind the grandmothers chair
then she took off her pretty dress and put her red shawl on over her underpetticoat which left her arms bare and now she clasped the old womans hand
i must go home to grandfather she said but tomorrow i shall come again
good night grandmother
yes come again be sure you come again tomorrow begged the grandmother as she pressed heidis hands in hers unwilling to let her go
why have you taken off that pretty dress
asked brigitta
because i would rather go home to grandfather as i am or else perhaps he would not know me you hardly did at first
brigitta went with her to the door and there said in rather a mysterious voice you might have kept on your dress he would have known you all right but you must be careful for peter tells me that almuncle is always now in a bad temper and never speaks
heidi bid her goodnight and continued her way up the mountain her basket on her arm
all around her the steep green slopes shone bright in the evening sun and soon the great gleaming snow field up above came in sight
heidi was obliged to keep on pausing to look behind her for the higher peaks were behind her as she climbed
suddenly a warm red glow fell on the grass at her feet she looked back againshe had not remembered how splendid it was nor seen anything to compare to it in her dreams for there the two high mountain peeks rose into the air like two great flames the whole snowfield had turned crimson and rosy colored clouds floated in the sky above
the grass upon the mountain sides had turned to gold the rocks were all aglow and the whole valley was bathed in golden mist
and as heidi stood gazing around her at all this splendor the tears ran down her cheeks for very delight and happiness and impulsively she put her hands together and lifting her eyes to heaven thanked god aloud for having brought her home thanked him that everything was as beautiful as ever more beautiful even than she had thought and that it was all hers again once more
and she was so overflowing with joy and thankfulness that she could not find words to thank him enough
not until the glory began to fade could she tear herself away
then she ran on so quickly that in a very little while she caught sight of the tops of the fir trees above the hut roof then the roof itself and at last the whole hut and there was grandfather sitting as in old days smoking his pipe and she could see the fir trees waving in the wind
quicker and quicker went her little feet and before almuncle had time to see who was coming heidi had rushed up to him thrown down her basket and flung her arms round his neck unable in the excitement of seeing him again to say more than grandfather
grandfather
over and over again
and the old man himself said nothing
for the first time for many years his eyes were wet and he had to pass his hand across them
then he unloosed heidis arms put her on his knee and after looking at her for a moment so you have come back to me heidi he said how is that
you dont look much of a grand lady
did they send you away
oh no grandfather said heidi eagerly you must not think that they were all so kindclara and grandmamma and herr sesemann
but you see grandfather i did not know how to bear myself till i got home again to you
i used to think i should die for i felt as if i could not breathe but i never said anything because it would have been ungrateful
and then suddenly one morning quite early herr sesemann said to mebut i think it was partly the doctors doingbut perhaps its all in the letter and heidi jumped down and fetched the roll and the letter and handed them both to her grandfather
that belongs to you said the latter laying the roll down on the bench beside him
then he opened the letter read it through and without a word put it in his pocket
do you think you can still drink milk with me heidi
he asked taking the child by the hand to go into the hut
but bring your money with you you can buy a bed and bedclothes and dresses for a couple of years with it
i am sure i do not want it replied heidi
i have got a bed already and clara has put such a lot of clothes in my box that i shall never want any more
take it and put it in the cupboard you will want it some day i have no doubt
heidi obeyed and skipped happily after her grandfather into the house she ran into all the corners delighted to see everything again and then went up the ladderbut there she came to a pause and called down in a tone of surprise and distress oh grandfather my beds gone
we can soon make it up again he answered her from below
i did not know that you were coming back come along now and have your milk
heidi came down sat herself on her high stool in the old place and then taking up her bowl drank her milk eagerly as if she had never come across anything so delicious and as she put down her bowl she exclaimed our milk tastes nicer than anything else in the world grandfather
a shrill whistle was heard outside
heidi darted out like a flash of lightning
there were the goats leaping and springing among the rocks with peter in their midst
when he caught sight of heidi he stood still with astonishment and gazed speechlessly at her
heidi called out goodevening peter and then ran in among the goats
little swan
little bear
do you know me again
and the animals evidently recognized her voice at once for they began rubbing their heads against her and bleating loudly as if for joy and as she called the other goats by name one after the other they all came scampering towards her helter skelter and crowding round her
the impatient greenfinch sprang into the air and over two of her companions in order to get nearer and even the shy little snowflake butted the great turk out of her way in quite a determined manner which left him standing taken aback by her boldness and lifting his beard in the air as much as to say you see who i am
heidi was out of her mind with delight at being among all her old friends again she flung her arms round the pretty little snowflake stroked the obstreperous greenfinch while she herself was thrust at from all sides by the affectionate and confiding goats and so at last she got near to where peter was still standing not having yet got over his surprise
come down peter cried heidi and say goodevening to me
so you are back again
he found words to say at last and now ran down and took heidis hand which she was holding out in greeting and immediately put the same question to her which he had been in the habit of doing in the old days when they returned home in the evening will you come out with me again to morrow
not tomorrow but the day after perhaps for tomorrow i must go down to grandmother
i am glad you are back said peter while his whole face beamed with pleasure and then he prepared to go on with his goats but he never had had so much trouble with them before for when at last by coaxing and threats he had got them all together and heidi had gone off with an arm over either head of her grandfathers two the whole flock suddenly turned and ran after her
heidi had to go inside the stall with her two and shut the door or peter would never have got home that night
when heidi went indoors after this she found her bed already made up for her the hay had been piled high for it and smelt deliciously for it had only just been got in and the grandfather had carefully spread and tucked in the clean sheets
it was with a happy heart that heidi lay down in it that night and her sleep was sounder than it had been for a whole year past
the grandfather got up at least ten times during the night and mounted the ladder to see if heidi was all right and showing no signs of restlessness and to feel that the hay he had stuffed into the round window was keeping the moon from shining too brightly upon her
but heidi did not stir she had no need now to wander about for the great burning longing of her heart was satisfied she had seen the high mountains and rocks alight in the evening glow she had heard the wind in the fir trees she was at home again on the mountain
sunday bells heidi was standing under the waving fir trees waiting for her grandfather who was going down with her to grandmothers and then on to dorfli to fetch her box
she was longing to know how grandmother had enjoyed her white bread and impatient to see and hear her again but no time seemed weary to her now for she could not listen long enough to the familiar voice of the trees or drink in too much of the fragrance wafted to her from the green pastures where the goldenheaded flowers were glowing in the sun a very feast to her eyes
the grandfather came out gave a look round and then called to her in a cheerful voice well now we can be off
it was saturday a day when almuncle made everything clean and tidy inside and outside the house he had devoted his morning to this work so as to be able to accompany heidi in the afternoon and the whole place was now as spick and span as he liked to see it
they parted at the grandmothers cottage and heidi ran in
the grandmother had heard her steps approaching and greeted her as she crossed the threshold is it you child
have you come again
then she took hold of heidis hand and held it fast in her own for she still seemed to fear that the child might be torn from her again
and now she had to tell heidi how much she had enjoyed the white bread and how much stronger she felt already for having been able to eat it and then peters mother went on and said she was sure that if her mother could eat like that for a week she would get back some of her strength but she was so afraid of coming to the end of the rolls that she had only eaten one as yet
heidi listened to all brigitta said and sat thinking for a while
then she suddenly thought of a way
i know grandmother what i will do she said eagerly i will write to clara and she will send me as many rolls again if not twice as many as you have already for i had ever such a large heap in the wardrobe and when they were all taken away she promised to give me as many back and she would do so i am sure
that is a good idea said brigitta but then they would get hard and stale
the baker in dorfli makes the white rolls and if we could get some of those he has over now and thenbut i can only just manage to pay for the black bread
a further bright thought came to heidi and with a look of joy oh i have lots of money grandmother she cried gleefully skipping about the room in her delight and i know now what i will do with it
you must have a fresh white roll every day and two on sunday and peter can bring them up from dorfli
no no child
answered the grandmother i cannot let you do that the money was not given to you for that purpose you must give it to your grandfather and he will tell you how you are to spend it
but heidi was not to be hindered in her kind intentions and she continued to jump about saying over and over again in a tone of exultation now grandmother can have a roll every day and will grow quite strong againand oh grandmother she suddenly exclaimed with an increase of jubilation in her voice if you get strong everything will grow light again for you perhaps its only because you are weak that it is dark
the grandmother said nothing she did not wish to spoil the childs pleasure
as she went jumping about heidi suddenly caught sight of the grandmothers song book and another happy idea struck her grandmother i can also read now would you like me to read you one of your hymns from your old book
oh yes said the grandmother surprised and delighted but can you really read child really
heidi had climbed on to a chair and had already lifted down the book bringing a cloud of dust with it for it had lain untouched on the shelf for a long time
heidi wiped it sat herself down on a stool beside the old woman and asked her which hymn she should read
what you like child what you like and the grandmother pushed her spinningwheel aside and sat in eager expectation waiting for heidi to begin
heidi turned over the leaves and read a line out softly to herself here and there
at last she said here is one about the sun grandmother i will read you that
and heidi began reading with more and more warmth of expression as she went on the morning breaks and warm and bright the earth lies still in the golden light for dawn has scattered the clouds of night
gods handiwork is seen around things great and small to his praise abound where are the signs of his love not found
all things must pass but god shall still with steadfast power his will fulfil sure and unshaken is his will
his saving grace will never fail though grief and fear the heart assail oer lifes wild seas he will prevail
joy shall be ours in that garden blest where after storm we find our rest i wait in peacegods time is best
the grandmother sat with folded hands and a look of indescribable joy on her face such as heidi had never seen there before although at the same time the tears were running down her cheeks
as heidi finished she implored her saying read it once again child just once again
and the child began again with as much pleasure in the verses as the grandmother joy shall be ours in that garden blest where after storm we find our rest i wait in peacegods time is best
ah heidi that brings light to the heart
what comfort you have brought me
and the old woman kept on repeating the glad words while heidi beamed with happiness and she could not take her eyes away from the grandmothers face which had never looked like that before
it had no longer the old troubled expression but was alight with peace and joy as if she were already looking with clear new eyes into the garden or paradise
some one now knocked at the window and heidi looked up and saw her grandfather beckoning her to come home with him
she promised the grandmother before leaving her that she would be with her the next day and even if she went out with peter she would only spend half the day with him for the thought that she might make it light and happy again for the grandmother gave her the greatest pleasure greater even than being out on the sunny mountain with the flowers and goats
as she was going out brigitta ran to her with the frock and hat she had left
heidi put the dress over her arm for as she thought to herself the grandfather had seen that before but she obstinately refused to take back the hat brigitta could keep it for she should never put it on her head again
heidi was so full of her mornings doings that she began at once to tell her grandfather all about them how the white bread could be fetched every day from dorfli if there was money for it and how the grandmother had all at once grown stronger and happier and light had come to her
then she returned to the subject of the rolls
if the grandmother wont take the money grandfather will you give it all to me and i can then give peter enough every day to buy a roll and two on sunday
but how about the bed
said her grandfather
it would be nice for you to have a proper bed and there would then be plenty for the bread
but heidi gave her grandfather no peace till he consented to do what she wanted she slept a great deal better she said on her bed of hay than on her fine pillowed bed in frankfurt
so at last he said the money is yours do what you like with it you can buy bread for grandmother for years to come with it
heidi shouted for joy at the thought that grandmother would never need any more to eat hard black bread and oh grandfather
she said everything is happier now than it has ever been in our lives before
and she sang and skipped along holding her grandfathers hand as lighthearted as a bird
but all at once she grew quiet and said if god had let me come at once as i prayed then everything would have been different i should only have had a little bread to bring to grandmother and i should not have been able to read which is such a comfort to her but god has arranged it all so much better than i knew how to everything has happened just as the other grandmother said it would
oh how glad i am that god did not let me have at once all i prayed and wept for
and now i shall always pray to god as she told me and always thank him and when he does not do anything i ask for i shall think to myself its just like it was in frankfurt god i am sure is going to do something better still
so we will pray every day wont we grandfather and never forget him again or else he may forget us
and supposing one does forget him
said the grandfather in a low voice
then everything goes wrong for god lets us then go where we like and when we get poor and miserable and begin to cry about it no one pities us but they say you ran away from god and so god who could have helped you left you to yourself
that is true heidi where did you learn that
from grandmamma she explained it all to me
the grandfather walked on for a little while without speaking then he said as if following his own train of thought and if it once is so it is so always no one can go back and he whom god has forgotten is forgotten for ever
oh no grandfather we can go back for grandmamma told me so and so it was in the beautiful tale in my bookbut you have not heard that yet but we shall be home directly now and then i will read it you and you will see how beautiful it is
and in her eagerness heidi struggled faster and faster up the steep ascent and they were no sooner at the top than she let go her grandfathers hand and ran into the hut
the grandfather slung the basket off his shoulders in which he had brought up a part of the contents of the trunk which was too heavy to carry up as it was
then he sat down on his seat and began thinking
heidi soon came running out with her book under her arm
thats right grandfather she exclaimed as she saw he had already taken his seat and in a second she was beside him and had her book open at the particular tale for she had read it so often that the leaves fell open at it of their own accord
and now in a sympathetic voice heidi began to read of the son when he was happily at home and went out into the fields with his fathers flocks and was dressed in a fine cloak and stood leaning on his shepherds staff watching as the sun went down just as he was to be seen in the picture
but then all at once he wanted to have his own goods and money and to be his own master and so he asked his father to give him his portion and he left his home and went and wasted all his substance
and when he had nothing left he hired himself out to a master who had no flocks and fields like his father but only swine to keep and so he was obliged to watch these and he only had rags to wear and a few husks to eat such as the swine fed upon
and then he thought of his old happy life at home and of how kindly his father had treated him and how ungrateful he had been and he wept for sorrow and longing
and he thought to himself i will arise and go to my father and will say to him father i am not worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants
and when he was yet a great way off his father saw him
here heidi paused in her reading
what do you think happens now grandfather
she said
do you think the father is still angry and will say to him i told you so
well listen now to what comes next
his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him
and the son said to him father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son
but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found
and they began to be merry
isnt that a beautiful tale grandfather said heidi as the latter continued to sit without speaking for she had expected him to express pleasure and astonishment
you are right heidi it is a beautiful tale he replied but he looked so grave as he said it that heidi grew silent herself and sat looking quietly at her pictures
presently she pushed her book gently in front of him and said see how happy he is there and she pointed with her finger to the figure of the returned prodigal who was standing by his father clad in fresh raiment as one of his own sons again
a few hours later as heidi lay fast asleep in her bed the grandfather went up the ladder and put his lamp down near her bed so that the light fell on the sleeping child
her hands were still folded as if she had fallen asleep saying her prayers an expression of peace and trust lay on the little face and something in it seemed to appeal to the grandfather for he stood a long time gazing down at her without speaking
at last he too folded his hands and with bowed head said in a low voice father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and am not worthy to be called thy son
and two large tears rolled down the old mans cheeks
early the next morning he stood in front of his hut and gazed quietly around him
the fresh bright morning sun lay on mountain and valley
the sound of a few early bells rang up from the valley and the birds were singing their morning song in the fir trees
he stepped back into the hut and called up come along heidi
the sun is up
put on your best frock for we are going to church together
heidi was not long getting ready it was such an unusual summons from her grandfather that she must make haste
she put on her smart frankfurt dress and soon went down but when she saw her grandfather she stood still gazing at him in astonishment
why grandfather
she exclaimed i never saw you look like that before
and the coat with the silver buttons
oh you do look nice in your sunday coat
the old man smiled and replied and you too now come along
he took heidis hand in his and together they walked down the mountain side
the bells were ringing in every direction now sounding louder and fuller as they neared the valley and heidi listened to them with delight
hark at them grandfather
its like a great festival
the congregation had already assembled and the singing had begun when heidi and her grandfather entered the church at dorfli and sat down at the back
but before the hymn was over every one was nudging his neighbor and whispering do you see
almuncle is in church
soon everybody in the church knew of almuncles presence and the women kept on turning round to look and quite lost their place in the singing
but everybody became more attentive when the sermon began for the preacher spoke with such warmth and thankfulness that those present felt the effect of his words as if some great joy had come to them all
at the close of the service almuncle took heidi by the hand and on leaving the church made his way towards the pastors house the rest of the congregation looked curiously after him some even following to see whether he went inside the pastors house which he did
then they collected in groups and talked over this strange event keeping their eyes on the pastors door watching to see whether almuncle came out looking angry and quarrelsome or as if the interview had been a peaceful one for they could not imagine what had brought the old man down and what it all meant
some however adopted a new tone and expressed their opinion that alm uncle was not so bad after all as they thought for see how carefully he took the little one by the hand
and others responded and said they had always thought people had exaggerated about him that if he was so downright bad he would be afraid to go inside the pastors house
then the miller put in his word did i not tell you so from the first
what child is there who would run away from where she had plenty to eat and drink and everything of the best home to a grandfather who was cruel and unkind and of whom she was afraid
and so everybody began to feel quite friendly towards almuncle and the women now came up and related all they had been told by peter and his grandmother and finally they all stood there like people waiting for an old friend whom they had long missed from among their number
meanwhile almuncle had gone into the pastors house and knocked at the study door
the latter came out and greeted him not as if he was surprised to see him but as if he had quite expected to see him there he probably had caught sight of the old man in church
he shook hands warmly with him and almuncle was unable at first to speak for he had not expected such a friendly reception
at last he collected himself and said i have come to ask you pastor to forget the words i spoke to you when you called on me and to beg you not to owe me illwill for having been so obstinately set against your wellmeant advice
you were right and i was wrong but i have now made up my mind to follow your advice and to find a place for myself at dorfli for the winter for the child is not strong enough to stand the bitter cold up on the mountain
and if the people down here look askance at me as at a person not to be trusted i know it is my own fault and you will i am sure not do so
the pastors kindly eyes shone with pleasure
he pressed the old mans hand in his and said with emotion neighbor you went into the right church before you came to mine i am greatly rejoiced
you will not repent coming to live with us again as for myself you will always be welcome as a dear friend and neighbor and i look forward to our spending many a pleasant winter evening together for i shall prize your companionship and we will find some nice friends too for the little one
and the pastor laid his hand kindly on the childs curly head and took her by the hand as he walked to the door with the old man
he did not say goodbye to him till they were standing outside so that all the people standing about saw him shake hands as if parting reluctantly from his best friend
the door had hardly shut behind him before the whole congregation now came forward to greet almuncle every one striving to be the first to shake hands with him and so many were held out that almuncle did not know with which to begin and some said we are so pleased to see you among us again and another i have long been wishing we could have a talk together again and greetings of all kinds echoed from every side and when almuncle told them he was thinking of returning to his old quarters in dorfli for the winter there was such a general chorus of pleasure that any one would have thought he was the most beloved person in all dorfli and that they had hardly known how to live without him
most of his friends accompanied him and heidi some way up the mountain and each as they bid him goodbye made him promise that when he next came down he would without fail come and call
as the old man at last stood alone with the child watching their retreating figures there was a light upon his face as if reflected from some inner sunshine of heart
heidi looking up at him with her clear steady eyes said grandfather you look nicer and nicer today i never saw you quite like that before
do you think so
he answered with a smile
well yes heidi i am happier today than i deserve happier than i had thought possible it is good to be at peace with god and man
god was good to me when he sent you to my hut
when they reached peters home the grandfather opened the door and walked straight in
goodmorning grandmother he said
i think we shall have to do some more patching up before the autumn winds come
dear god if it is not uncle
cried the grandmother in pleased surprise
that i should live to see such a thing
and now i can thank you for all that you have done for me
may god reward you
she stretched out a trembling hand to him and when the grandfather shook it warmly she went on still holding his and i have something on my heart i want to say a prayer to make to you
if i have injured you in any way do not punish me by sending the child away again before i lie under the grass
oh you do not know what that child is to me
and she clasped the child to her for heidi had already taken her usual stand close to the grandmother
have no fear grandmother said uncle in a reassuring voice i shall not punish either you or myself by doing so
we are all together now and pray god we may continue so for long
brigitta now drew the uncle aside towards a corner of the room and showed him the hat with the feathers explaining to him how it came there and adding that of course she could not take such a thing from a child
but the grandfather looked towards heidi without any displeasure of countenance and said the hat is hers and if she does not wish to wear it any more she has a right to say so and to give it to you so take it pray
brigitta was highly delighted at this
it is well worth more than ten shillings
she said as she held it up for further admiration
and what a blessing heidi has brought home with her from frankfurt
i have thought sometimes that it might be good to send peter there for a little while what do you think uncle
a merry look came into the grandfathers eye
he thought it would do peter no harm but he had better wait for a good opportunity before starting
at this moment the subject of their conversation himself rushed in evidently in a great hurry knocking his head violently against the door in his haste so that everything in the room rattled
gasping and breathless he stood still after this and held out a letter
this was another great event for such a thing had never happened before the letter was addressed to heidi and had been delivered at the post office in dorfli
they all sat down round the table to hear what was in it for heidi opened it at once and read it without hesitation
the letter was from clara
the latter wrote that the house had been so dull since heidi left that she did not know how to bear herself and she had at last persuaded her father to take her to the baths at ragatz in the coming autumn grandmamma had arranged to join them there and they both were looking forward to paying her and her grandfather a visit
and grandmamma sent a further message to heidi which was that the latter had done quite right to take the rolls to the grandmother and so that she might not have to eat them dry she was sending some coffee which was already on its way and grandmamma hoped when she came to the alm in the autumn that heidi would take her to see her old friend
there were exclamations of pleasure and astonishment on hearing all this news and so much to talk and ask about that even the grandfather did not notice how the time was passing there was general delight at the thought of the coming days and even more at the meeting which had taken place on this one and the grandmother spoke and said the happiest of all things is when an old friend comes and greets us as in former times the heart is comforted with the assurance that some day everything that we have loved will be given back to us
you will come soon again uncle and you child tomorrow
the old man and heidi promised her faithfully to do so then it was time to break up the party and these two went back up the mountain
as they had been greeted with bells when they made their journey down in the morning so now they were accompanied by the peaceful evening chimes as they climbed to the hut which had quite a sundaylike appearance as it stood bathed in the light of the low evening sun
but when grandmamma comes next autumn there will be many fresh joys and surprises both for heidi and grandmother without doubt a proper bed will be put up in the hayloft for wherever grandmamma steps in there everything is soon in right order outside and in
preparations for a journey the kind doctor who had given the order that heidi was to be sent home was walking along one of the broad streets towards herr sesemanns house
it was a sunny september morning so full of light and sweetness that it seemed as if everybody must rejoice
but the doctor walked with his eyes fastened to the ground and did not once lift them to the blue sky above him
there was an expression of sadness on his face formerly so cheerful and his hair had grown greyer since the spring
the doctor had had an only daughter who after his wifes death had been his sole and constant companion but only a few months previously death had deprived him of his dear child and he had never been the same bright and cheery man since
sebastian opened the door to him greeting him with every mark of respectful civility for the doctor was not only the most cherished friend of the master and his daughter but had by his kindness won the hearts of the whole household
everything as usual sebastian
asked the doctor in his pleasant voice as he preceded sebastian up the stairs
i am glad you have come doctor exclaimed herr sesemann as the latter entered
we must really have another talk over this swiss journey do you still adhere to your decision even though clara is decidedly improving in health
my dear sesemann i never knew such a man as you
said the doctor as he sat down beside his friend
i really wish your mother was here everything would be clear and straightforward then and she would soon put things in right train
you sent for me three times yesterday only to ask me the same question though you know what i think
yes i know its enough to make you out of patience with me but you must understand dear friendand herr sesemann laid his hand imploringly on the doctors shoulderthat i feel i have not the courage to refuse the child what i have been promising her all along and for months now she has been living on the thought of it day and night
she bore this last bad attack so patiently because she was buoyed up with the hope that she should soon start on her swiss journey and see her friend heidi again and now must i tell the poor child who has to give up so many pleasures that this visit she has so long looked forward to must also be cancelled
i really have not the courage to do it
you must make up your mind to it sesemann said the doctor with authority and as his friend continued silent and dejected he went on after a pause consider yourself how the matter stands
clara has not had such a bad summer as this last one for years
only the worst results would follow from the fatigue of such a journey and it is out of the question for her
and then we are already in september and although it may still be warm and fine up there it may just as likely be already very cold
the days too are growing short and as clara cannot spend the night up there she would only have a two hours visit at the outside
the journey from ragatz would take hours for she would have to be carried up the mountain in a chair
in short sesemann it is impossible
but i will go in with you and talk to clara she is a reasonable child and i will tell her what my plans are
next may she shall be taken to the baths and stay there for the cure until it is quite hot weather
then she can be carried up the mountain from time to time and when she is stronger she will enjoy these excursions far more than she would now
understand sesemann that if we want to give the child a chance of recovery we must use the utmost care and watchfulness
herr sesemann who had listened to the doctor in sad and submissive silence now suddenly jumped up
doctor he said tell me truly have you really any hope of her final recovery
the doctor shrugged his shoulders
very little he replied quietly
but friend think of my trouble
you have still a beloved child to look for you and greet you on your return home
you do not come back to an empty house and sit down to a solitary meal
and the child is happy and comfortable at home too
if there is much that she has to give up she has on the other hand many advantages
no sesemann you are not so greatly to be pitiedyou have still the happiness of being together
think of my lonely house
herr sesemann was now striding up and down the room as was his habit when deeply engaged in thought
suddenly he came to a pause beside his friend and laid his hand on his shoulder
doctor i have an idea i cannot bear to see you look as you do you are no longer the same man
you must be taken out of yourself for a while and what do you think i propose
that you shall take the journey and go and pay heidi a visit in our name
the doctor was taken aback at this sudden proposal and wanted to make objections but his friend gave him no time to say anything
he was so delighted with his idea that he seized the doctor by the arm and drew him into claras room
the kind doctor was always a welcome visitor to clara for he generally had something amusing to tell her
lately it is true he had been graver but clara knew the reason why and would have given much to see him his old lively self again
she held out her hand to him as he came up to her he took a seat beside her and her father also drew up his chair and taking claras hand in his began to talk to her of the swiss journey and how he himself had looked forward to it
he passed as quickly as he could over the main point that it was now impossible for her to undertake it for he dreaded the tears that would follow but he went on without pause to tell her of his new plan and dwelt on the great benefit it would be to his friend if he could be persuaded to take this holiday
the tears were indeed swimming in the blue eyes although clara struggled to keep them down for her fathers sake but it was a bitter disappointment to give up the journey the thought of which had been her only joy and solace during the lonely hours of her long illness
she knew however that her father would never refuse her a thing unless he was certain that it would be harmful for her
so she swallowed her tears as well as she could and turned her thoughts to the one hope still left her
taking the doctors hand and stroking it she said pleadingly dear doctor you will go and see heidi wont you
and then you can come and tell me all about it what it is like up there and what heidi and the grandfather and peter and the goats do all day
i know them all so well
and then you can take what i want to send to heidi i have thought about it all and also something for the grandmother
do pray go dear doctor and i will take as much cod liver oil as you like
whether this promise finally decided the doctor it is impossible to say but it is certain that he smiled and said then i must certainly go clara for you will then get as plump and strong as your father and i wish to see you
and have you decided when i am to start
tomorrow morningearly if possible replied clara
yes she is right put in herr sesemann the sun is shining and the sky is blue and there is no time to be lost it is a pity to miss a single one of these days on the mountain
the doctor could not help laughing
you will be reproaching me next for not being there already well i must go and make arrangements for getting off
but clara would not let him go until she had given him endless messages for heidi and had explained all he was to look at so as to give her an exact description on his return
her presents she would send round later as fraulein rottenmeier must first help her to pack them up at that moment she was out on one of her excursions into the town which always kept her engaged for some time
the doctor promised to obey claras directions in every particular he would start some time during the following day if not the first thing in the morning and would bring back a faithful account of his experiences and of all he saw and heard
the servants of a household have a curious faculty of divining what is going on before they are actually told about anything
sebastian and tinette must have possessed this faculty in a high degree for even as the doctor was going downstairs tinette who had been rung for entered claras room
take that box and bring it back filled with the soft cakes which we have with coffee said clara pointing to a box which had been brought long before in preparation for this
tinette took it up and carried it out dangling it contemptuously in her hand
hardly worth the trouble i should have thought she said pertly as she left the room
as sebastian opened the door for the doctor he said with a bow will the herr doctor be so kind as to give the little miss my greetings
i see said the doctor you know then already that i am off on a journey
sebastian hesitated and gave an awkward little cough
i ami havei hardly know myself
o yes i remember i happened to pass through the diningroom and caught little misss name and i put two and two togetherand so i thought i see i see smiled the doctor one can find out a great many thinks by thinking
goodbye till i see you again sebastian i will be sure and give your message
the doctor was hastening off when he met with a sudden obstacle the violent wind had prevented fraulein rottenmeier prosecuting her walk any farther and she was just returning and had reached the door as he was coming out
the white shawl she wore was so blown out by the wind that she looked like a ship in full sail
the doctor drew back but fraulein rottenmeier had always evinced peculiar appreciation and respect for this man and she also drew back with exaggerated politeness to let him pass
the two stood for a few seconds each anxious to make way for the other but a sudden gust of wind sent fraulein rottenmeier flying with all her sails almost into the doctors arms and she had to pause and recover herself before she could shake hands with the doctor with becoming decorum
she was put out at having been forced to enter in so undignified a manner but the doctor had a way of smoothing peoples ruffled feathers and she was soon listening with her usual composure while he informed her of his intended journey begging her in his most conciliatory voice to pack up the parcels for heidi as she alone knew how to pack
and then he took his leave
clara quite expected to have a long tussle with fraulein rottenmeier before she would get the latter to consent to sending all the things that she had collected as presents for heidi
but this time she was mistaken for fraulein rottenmeier was in a more than usually good temper
she cleared the large table so that all the things for heidi could be spread out upon it and packed under claras own eyes
it was no light job for the presents were of all shapes and sizes
first there was the little warm cloak with a hood which had been designed by clara herself in order that heidi during the coming winter might be able to go and see grandmother when she liked and not have to wait till her grandfather could take her wrapped up in a sack to keep her from freezing
then came a thick warm shawl for the grandmother in which she could wrap herself well up and not feel the cold when the wind came sweeping in such terrible gusts round the house
the next object was the large box full of cakes these were also for the grandmother that she might have something to eat with her coffee besides bread
an immense sausage was the next article this had been originally intended for peter who never had anything but bread and cheese but clara had altered her mind fearing that in his delight he might eat it all up at once and make himself ill
so she arranged to send it to brigitta who could take some for herself and the grandmother and give peter his portion out by degrees
a packet of tobacco was a present for grandfather who was fond of his pipe as he sat resting in the evening
finally there was a whole lot of mysterious little bags and parcels and boxes which clara had had especial pleasure in collecting as each was to be a joyful surprise for heidi as she opened it
the work came to an end at last and an imposinglooking package lay on the floor ready for transport
fraulein rottenmeier looked at it with satisfaction lost in the consideration of the art of packing
clara eyed it too with pleasure picturing heidis exclamations and jumps of joy and surprise when the huge parcel arrived at the hut
and now sebastian came in and lifting the package on to his shoulder carried it off to be forwarded at once to the doctors house
a visitor the early light of morning lay rosy red upon the mountains and a fresh breeze rustled through the fir trees and set their ancient branches waving to and fro
the sound awoke heidi and she opened her eyes
the roaring in the trees always stirred a strong emotion within her and seemed to drew her irresistibly to them
so she jumped out of bed and dressed herself as quickly as she could but it took her some time even then for she was careful now to be always clean and tidy
when she went down her ladder she found her grandfather had already left the hut
he was standing outside looking at the sky and examining the landscape as he did every morning to see what sort of weather it was going to be
little pink clouds were floating over the sky that was growing brighter and bluer with every minute while the heights and the meadow lands were turning gold under the rising sun which was just appearing above the topmost peaks
o how beautiful
how beautiful
goodmorning grandfather
cried heidi running out
what you are awake already are you
he answered giving her a morning greeting
then heidi ran round to the fir trees to enjoy the sound she loved so well and with every fresh gust of wind which came roaring through their branches she gave a fresh jump and cry of delight
meanwhile the grandfather had gone to milk the goats this done he brushed and washed them ready for their mountain excursion and brought them out of their shed
as soon as heidi caught sight of her two friends she ran and embraced them and they bleated in return while they vied with each other in showing their affection by poking their heads against her and trying which could get nearest her so that she was almost crushed between them
but heidi was not afraid of them and when the lively little bear gave rather too violent a thrust she only said no little bear you are pushing like the great turk and little bear immediately drew back his head and left off his rough attentions while little swan lifted her head and put on an expression as much as to say no one shall ever accuse me of behaving like the great turk
for white swan was a rather more distinguished person than brown bear
and now peters whistle was heard and all the goats came along leaping and springing and heidi soon found herself surrounded by the whole flock pushed this way and that by their obstreperous greetings but at last she managed to get through them to where snowflake was standing for the young goat had in vain striven to reach her
peter now gave a last tremendous whistle in order to startle the goats and drive them off for he wanted to get near himself to say something to heidi
the goats sprang aside and he came up to her
can you come out with me today
he asked evidently unwilling to hear her refuse
i am afraid i cannot peter she answered
i am expecting them every minute from frankfurt and i must be at home when they come
you have said the same thing for days now grumbled peter
i must continue to say it till they come replied heidi
how can you think peter that i would be away when they came
as if i could do such a thing
they would find uncle at home he answered with a snarling voice
but at this moment the grandfathers stentorian voice was heard
why is the army not marching forward
is it the fieldmarshal who is missing or some of the troops
whereupon peter turned and went off swinging his stick round so that it whistled through the air and the goats who understood the signal started at full trot for their mountain pasture peter following in their wake
since heidi had been back with her grandfather things came now and then into her mind of which she had never thought in former days
so now with great exertion she put her bed in order every morning patting and stroking it till she had got it perfectly smooth and flat
then she went about the room downstairs put each chair back in its place and if she found anything lying about she put it in the cupboard
after that she fetched a duster climbed on a chair and rubbed the table till it shone again
when the grandfather came in later he would look round well pleased and say to himself we look like sunday every day now heidi did not go abroad for nothing
after peter had departed and she and her grandfather had breakfasted heidi began her daily work as usual but she did not get on with it very fast
it was so lovely out of doors to day and every minute something happened to interrupt her in her work
now it was a bright beam of sun shining cheerfully through the open window and seeming to say come out heidi come out
heidi felt she could not stay indoors and she ran out in answer to the call
the sunlight lay sparkling on everything around the hut and on all the mountains and far away along the valley and the grass slope looked so golden and inviting that she was obliged to sit down for a few minutes and look about her
then she suddenly remembered that her stool was left standing in the middle of the floor and that the table had not been rubbed and she jumped up and ran inside again
but it was not long before the fir trees began their old song heidi felt it in all her limbs and again the desire to run outside was irresistible and she was off to play and leap to the tune of the waving branches
the grandfather who was busy in his workshed stepped out from time to time smiling to watch her at her gambols
he had just gone back to his work on one of these occasions when heidi called out grandfather
come come
he stepped quickly out almost afraid something had happened to the child but he saw her running towards where the mountain path descended crying they are coming
they are coming
and the doctor is in front of them
heidi rushed forward to welcome her old friend who held out his hands in greeting to her
when she came up to him she clung to his outstretched arm and exclaimed in the joy of her heart goodmorning doctor and thank you ever so many times
god bless you child
what have you got to thank me for
asked the doctor smiling
for being at home again with grandfather the child explained
the doctors face brightened as if a sudden ray of sunshine had passed across it he had not expected such a reception as this
lost in the sense of his loneliness he had climbed the mountain without heeding how beautiful it was on every side and how more and more beautiful it became the higher he got
he had quite thought that heidi would have forgotten him she had seen so little of him and he had felt rather like one bearing a message of disappointment anticipating no great show of favor coming as he did without the expected friends
but instead here was heidi her eyes dancing for joy and full of gratitude and affection clinging to the arm of her kind friend
he took her by the hand with fatherly tenderness
take me now to your grandfather heidi and show me where you live
but heidi still remained standing looking down the path with a questioning gaze
where are clara and grandmother
she asked
ah now i have to tell you something which you will be as sorry about as i am answered the doctor
you see heidi i have come alone
clara was very ill and could not travel and so the grandmother stayed behind too
but next spring when the days grow warm and long again they are coming here for certain
heidi was greatly concerned she could not at first bring herself to believe that what she had for so long been picturing to herself was not going to happen after all
she stood motionless for a second or two overcome by the unexpected disappointment
the doctor said nothing further all around lay the silence only the sighing of the fir trees could be heard from where they stood
then heidi suddenly remembered why she had run down there and that the doctor had really come
she lifted her eyes and saw the sad expression in his as he looked down at her she had never seen him with that look on his face when she was in frankfurt
it went to heidis heart she could not bear to see anybody unhappy especially her dear doctor
no doubt it was because clara and grandmother could not come and so she began to think how best she might console him
oh it wont be very long to wait for spring and then they will be sure to come she said in a reassuring voice
time passes very quickly with us and then they will be able to stay longer when they are here and clara will be pleased at that
now let us go and find grandfather
hand in hand with her friend she climbed up to the hut
she was so anxious to make the doctor happy again that she began once more assuring him that the winter passed so quickly on the mountain that it was hardly to be taken account of and that summer would be back again before they knew it and she became so convinced of the truth of her own words that she called out quite cheerfully to her grandfather as they approached they have not come today but they will be here in a very short time
the doctor was no stranger to the grandfather for the child had talked to him so much about her friend
the old man held out his hand to his guest in friendly greeting
then the two men sat down in front of the hut and heidi had her little place too for the doctor beckoned her to come and sit beside him
the doctor told uncle how herr sesemann had insisted on his taking this journey and he felt himself it would do him good as he had not been quite the thing for a long time
then he whispered to heidi that there was something being brought up the mountain which had travelled with him from frankfurt and which would give her even more pleasure than seeing the old doctor
heidi got into a great state of excitement on hearing this wondering what it could be the old man urged the doctor to spend as many of the beautiful autumn days on the mountain as he could and at least to come up whenever it was fine he could not offer him a lodging as he had no place to put him he advised the doctor however not to go back to ragatz but to stay at dorfli where there was a clean tidy little inn
then the doctor could come up every morning which would do him no end of good and if he liked he the grandfather would act as his guide to any part of the mountains he would like to see
the doctor was delighted with this proposal and it was settled that it should be as the grandfather suggested
meanwhile the sun had been climbing up the sky and it was now noon
the wind had sunk and the fir trees stood motionless
the air was still wonderfully warm and mild for that height while a delicious freshness was mingled with the warmth of the sun
almuncle now rose and went indoors returning in a few minutes with a table which he placed in front of the seat
there heidi now run in and bring us what we want for the table he said
the doctor must take us as he finds us if the food is plain he will acknowledge that the diningroom is pleasant
i should think so indeed replied the doctor as he looked down over the sunlit valley and i accept the kind invitation everything must taste good up here
heidi ran backwards and forwards as busy as a bee and brought out everything she could find in the cupboard for she did not know how to be pleased enough that she could help to entertain the doctor
the grandfather meanwhile had been preparing the meal and now appeared with a steaming jug of milk and golden brown toasted cheese
then he cut some thin slices from the meat he had cured himself in the pure air and the doctor enjoyed his dinner better than he had for a whole year past
our clara must certainly come up here he said it would make her quite a different person and if she ate for any length of time as i have today she would grow plumper than any one has ever known her before
as he spoke a man was seen coming up the path carrying a large package on his back
when he reached the hut he threw it on the ground and drew in two or three good breaths of the mountain air
ah heres what travelled with me from frankfurt said the doctor rising and he went up to the package and began undoing it heidi looking on in great expectation
after he had released it from its heavy outer covering there child he said now you can go on unpacking your treasures yourself
heidi undid her presents one by one until they were all displayed she could not speak the while for wonder and delight
not till the doctor went up to her again and opened the large box to show heidi the cakes that were for the grandmother to eat with her coffee did she at last give a cry of joy exclaiming now grandmother will have nice things to eat and she wanted to pack everything up again and start at once to give them to her
but the grandfather said he should walk down with the doctor that evening and she could go with them and take the things
heidi now found the packet of tobacco which she ran and gave to her grandfather he was so pleased with it that he immediately filled his pipe with some and the two men then sat down together again the smoke curling up from their pipes as they talked of all kinds of things while heidi continued to examine first one and then another of her presents
suddenly she ran up to them and standing in front of the doctor waited till there was a pause in the conversation and then said no the other thing has not given me more pleasure than seeing you doctor
the two men could not help laughing and the doctor answered that he should never have thought it
as the sun began to sink behind the mountains the doctor rose thinking it was time to return to dorfli and seek for quarters
the grandfather carried the cakes and the shawl and the large sausage and the doctor took heidis hand so they all three started down the mountain
arrived at peters home heidi bid the others goodbye she was to wait at grandmothers till her grandfather who was going on to dorfli with his guest returned to fetch her
as the doctor shook hands with her she asked would you like to come out with the goats tomorrow morning
for she could think of no greater treat to offer him
agreed
answered the doctor we will go together heidi now ran in to the grandmother she first with some effort managed to carry in the box of cakes then she ran out again and brought in the sausagefor her grandfather had put the presents down by the doorand then a third time for the shawl
she had placed them as close as she could to the grandmother so that the latter might be able to feel them and understand what was there
the shawl she laid over the old womans knees
they are all from frankfurt from clara and grandmamma she explained to the astonished grandmother and brigitta the latter having watched her dragging in all the heavy things unable to imagine what was happening
and you are very pleased with the cakes arent you grandmother
taste how soft they are
said heidi over and over again to which the grandmother continued to answer yes yes heidi i should think so
what kind people they must be
and then she would pass her hand over the warm thick shawl and add this will be beautiful for the cold winter
i never thought i should ever have such a splendid thing as this to put on
heidi could not help feeling some surprise at the grandmother seeming to take more pleasure in the shawl than the cakes
meanwhile brigitta stood gazing at the sausage with almost an expression of awe
she had hardly in her life seen such a monster sausage much less owned one and she could scarcely believe her eyes
she shook her head and said doubtfully i must ask uncle what it is meant for but heidi answered without hesitation it is meant for eating not for anything else
peter came tumbling in at this minute
uncle is just behind me he is coming he began and then stopped short for his eye had caught sight of the sausage and he was too much taken aback to say more
but heidi understood that her grandfather was near and so said goodbye to grandmother
the old man now never passed the door without going in to wish the old woman goodday and she liked to hear his footstep approaching for he always had a cheery word for her
but today it was growing late for heidi who was always up with the lark and the grandfather would never let her go to bed after hours so this evening he only called goodnight through the open door and started home at once with the child and the two climbed under the starlit sky back to their peaceful dwelling
the next morning the doctor climbed up from dorfli with peter and the goats
the kindly gentleman tried now and then to enter into conversation with the boy but his attempts failed for he could hardly get a word out of peter in answer to his questions
peter was not easily persuaded to talk
so the party silently made their way up to the hut where they found heidi awaiting them with her two goats all three as fresh and lively as the morning sun among the mountains
are you coming today
said peter repeating the words with which he daily greeted her either in question or in summons
of course i am if the doctor is coming too replied heidi
peter cast a sidelong glance at the doctor
the grandfather now came out with the dinner bag and after bidding goodday to the doctor he went up to peter and slung it over his neck
it was heavier than usual for almuncle had added some meat today as he thought the doctor might like to have his lunch out and eat it when the children did
peter gave a grin for he felt sure there was something more than ordinary in it
and so the ascent began
the goats as usual came thronging around heidi each trying to be nearest her until at last she stood still and said now you must go on in front and behave properly and not keep on turning back and pushing and poking me for i want to talk to the doctor and she gave snowflake a little pat on the back and told her to be good and obedient
by degrees she managed to make her way out from among them and joined the doctor who took her by the hand
he had no difficulty now in conversing with his companion for heidi had a great deal to say about the goats and their peculiarities and about the flowers and the rocks and the birds and so they clambered on and reached their restingplace before they were aware
peter had sent a good many unfriendly glances towards the doctor on the way up which might have quite alarmed the latter if he had happened to notice them which fortunately he did not
heidi now led her friend to her favorite spot where she was accustomed to sit and enjoy the beauty around her the doctor followed her example and took his seat beside her on the warm grass
over the heights and over the far green valley hung the golden glory of the autumn day
the great snowfield sparkled in the bright sunlight and the two grey rocky peaks rose in their ancient majesty against the dark blue sky
a soft light morning breeze blew deliciously across the mountain gently stirring the bluebells that still remained of the summers wealth of flowers their slender heads nodding cheerfully in the sunshine
overhead the great bird was flying round and round in wide circles but to day he made no sound poised on his large wings he floated contentedly in the blue ether
heidi looked about her first at one thing and then at another
the waving flowers the blue sky the bright sunshine the happy birdeverything was so beautiful
so beautiful
her eyes were alight with joy
and now she turned to her friend to see if he too were enjoying the beauty
the doctor had been sitting thoughtfully gazing around him
as he met her glad bright eyes yes heidi he responded i see how lovely it all is but tell meif one brings a sad heart up here how may it be healed so that it can rejoice in all this beauty
oh but exclaimed heidi no one is sad up here only in frankfurt
the doctor smiled and then growing serious again he continued but supposing one is not able to leave all the sadness behind at frankfurt can you tell me anything that will help then
when you do not know what more to do you must go and tell everything to god answered heidi with decision
ah that is a good thought of yours heidi said the doctor
but if it is god himself who has sent the trouble what can we say to him then
heidi sat pondering for a while she was sure in her heart that god could help out of every trouble
she thought over her own experiences and then found her answer
then you must wait she said and keep on saying to yourself god certainly knows of some happiness for us which he is going to bring out of the trouble only we must have patience and not run away
and then all at once something happens and we see clearly ourselves that god has had some good thought in his mind all along but because we cannot see things beforehand and only know how dreadfully miserable we are we think it is always going to be so
that is a beautiful faith child and be sure you hold it fast replied the doctor
then he sat on a while in silence looking at the great overshadowing mountains and the green sunlit valley below before he spoke again can you understand heidi that a man may sit here with such a shadow over his eyes that he cannot feel and enjoy the beauty around him while the heart grows doubly sad knowing how beautiful it could be
can you understand that
a pain shot through the childs young happy heart
the shadow over the eyes brought to her remembrance the grandmother who would never again be able to see the sunlight and the beauty up here
this was heidis great sorrow which reawoke each time she thought about the darkness
she did not speak for a few minutes for her happiness was interrupted by this sudden pang
then in a grave voice she said yes i can understand it
and i know this that then one must say one of grandmothers hymns which bring the light back a little and often make it so bright for her that she is quite happy again
grandmother herself told me this
which hymns are they heidi
asked the doctor
i only know the one about the sun and the beautiful garden and some of the verses of the long one which are favorites with her and she always likes me to read them to her two or three times over replied heidi
well say the verses to me then i should like to hear them too and the doctor sat up in order to listen better
heidi put her hands together and sat collecting her thoughts for a second or two shall i begin at the verse that grandmother says gives her a feeling of hope and confidence
the doctor nodded his assent and heidi began let not your heart be troubled nor fear your soul dismay there is a wise defender and he will be your stay
where you have failed he conquers see how the foeman flies
and all your tribulation is turned to glad surprise
if for a while it seemeth his mercy is withdrawn that he no longer careth for his wandering child forlorn doubt not his great compassion his love can never tire to those who wait in patience he gives their hearts desire
heidi suddenly paused she was not sure if the doctor was still listening
he was sitting motionless with his hand before his eyes
she thought he had fallen asleep when he awoke if he wanted to hear more verses she would go on
there was no sound anywhere
the doctor sat in silence but he was certainly not asleep
his thoughts had carried him back to a long past time he saw himself as a little boy standing by his dear mothers chair she had her arm round his neck and was saying the very verses to him that heidi had just recitedwords which he had not heard now for years
he could hear his mothers voice and see her loving eyes resting upon him and as heidi ceased the old dear voice seemed to be saying other things to him and the words he heard again must have carried him far far away for it was a long time before he stirred or took his hand from his eyes
when at last he roused himself he met heidis eyes looking wonderingly at him
heidi he said taking the childs hand in his that was a beautiful hymn of yours and there was a happier ring in his voice as he spoke
we will come out here together another day and you will let me hear it again
peter meanwhile had had enough to do in giving vent to his anger
it was now some days since heidi had been out with him and when at last she did come there she sat the whole time beside the old gentleman and peter could not get a word with her
he got into a terrible temper and at last went and stood some way back behind the doctor where the latter could not see him and doubling his fist made imaginary hits at the enemy
presently he doubled both fists and the longer heidi stayed beside the gentleman the more fiercely did he threaten with them
meanwhile the sun had risen to the height which peter knew pointed to the dinner hour
all of a sudden he called at the top of his voice its dinner time
heidi was rising to fetch the dinner bag so that the doctor might eat his where he sat
but he stopped her telling her he was not hungry at all and only cared for a glass of milk as he wanted to climb up a little higher
then heidi found that she also was not hungry and only wanted milk and she should like she said to take the doctor up to the large mosscovered rock where greenfinch had nearly jumped down and killed herself
so she ran and explained matters to peter telling him to go and get milk for the two
peter seemed hardly to understand
who is going to eat what is in the bag then
you can have it she answered only first make haste and get the milk
peter had seldom performed any task more promptly for he thought of the bag and its contents which now belonged to him
as soon as the other two were sitting quietly drinking their milk he opened it and quite trembled for joy at the sight of the meat and he was just putting his hand in to draw it out when something seemed to hold him back
his conscience smote him at the remembrance of how he had stood with his doubled fists behind the doctor who was now giving up to him his whole good dinner
he felt as if he could not now enjoy it
but all at once he jumped up and ran back to the spot where he had stood before and there held up his open hands as a sign that he had no longer any wish to use them as fists and kept them up until he felt he had made amends for his past conduct
then he rushed back and sat down to the double enjoyment of a clear conscience and an unusually satisfying meal
heidi and the doctor climbed and talked for a long while until the latter said it was time for him to be going back and no doubt heidi would like to go and be with her goats
but heidi would not hear of this as then the doctor would have to go the whole way down the mountain alone
she insisted on accompanying him as far as the grandfathers hut or even a little further
she kept hold of her friends hand all the time and the whole way she entertained him with accounts of this thing and that showing him the spots where the goats loved best to feed and others where in summer the flowers of all colors grew in greatest abundance
she could give them all their right names for her grandfather had taught her these during the summer months
but at last the doctor insisted on her going back so they bid each other goodnight and the doctor continued his descent turning now and again to look back and each time he saw heidi standing on the same spot and waving her hand to him
even so in the old days had his own dear little daughter watched him when he went from home
it was a bright sunny autumn month
the doctor came up to the hut every morning and thence made excursions over the mountain
almuncle accompanied him on some of his higher ascents when they climbed up to the ancient stormbeaten fir trees and often disturbed the great bird which rose startled from its nest with the whirl of wings and croakings very near their heads
the doctor found great pleasure in his companions conversation and was astonished at his knowledge of the plants that grew on the mountain he knew the uses of them all from the aromatic fir trees and the dark pines with their scented needles to the curly moss that sprang up everywhere about the roots of the trees and the smallest plant and tiniest flower
he was as well versed also in the ways of the animals great and small and had many amusing anecdotes to tell of these dwellers in caves and holes and in the tops of the fir trees
and so the time passed pleasantly and quickly for the doctor who seldom said goodbye to the old man at the end of the day without adding i never leave you friend without having learnt something new from you
on some of the very finest days however the doctor would wander out again with heidi and then the two would sit together as on the first day and the child would repeat her hymns and tell the doctor things which she alone knew
peter sat at a little distance from them but he was now quite reconciled in spirit and gave vent to no angry pantomime
september had drawn to its close and now one morning the doctor appeared looking less cheerful than usual
it was his last day he said as he must return to frankfurt but he was grieved at having to say goodbye to the mountain which he had begun to feel quite like home
almuncle on his side greatly regretted the departure of his guest and heidi had been now accustomed for so long to see her good friend every day that she could hardly believe the time had suddenly come to separate
she looked up at him in doubt taken by surprise but there was no help he must go
so he bid farewell to the old man and asked that heidi might go with him part of the return way and heidi took his hand and went down the mountain with him still unable to grasp the idea that he was going for good
after some distance the doctor stood still and passing his hand over the childs curly head said now heidi you must go back and i must say goodbye
if only i could take you with me to frankfurt and keep you there
the picture of frankfurt rose before the childs eyes its rows of endless houses its hard streets and even the vision of fraulein rottenmeier and tinette and she answered hesitatingly i would rather that you came back to us
yes you are right that would be better
but now goodbye heidi
the child put her hand in his and looked up at him the kind eyes looking down on her had tears in them
then the doctor tore himself away and quickly continued his descent
heidi remained standing without moving
the friendly eyes with the tears in them had gone to her heart
all at once she burst into tears and started running as fast as she could after the departing figure calling out in broken tones doctor
doctor
he turned round and waited till the child reached him
the tears were streaming down her face and she sobbed out i will come to frankfurt with you now at once and i will stay with you as long as you like only i must just run back and tell grandfather
the doctor laid his hand on her and tried to calm her excitement
no no dear child he said kindly not now you must stay for the present under the fir trees or i should have you ill again
but hear now what i have to ask you
if i am ever ill and alone will you come then and stay with me
may i know that there would then be some one to look after me and care for me
yes yes i will come the very day you send for me and i love you nearly as much as grandfather replied heidi who had not yet got over her distress
and so the doctor again bid her goodbye and started on his way while heidi remained looking after him and waving her hand as long as a speck of him could be seen
as the doctor turned for the last time and looked back at the waving heidi and the sunny mountain he said to himself it is good to be up there good for body and soul and a man might learn how to be happy once more
the snow was lying so high around the hut that the windows looked level with the ground and the door had entirely disappeared from view
if almuncle had been up there he would have had to do what peter did daily for fresh snow fell every night
peter had to get out of the window of the sittingroom every morning and if the frost had not been very hard during the night he immediately sank up to his shoulders almost in the snow and had to struggle with hands feet and head to extricate himself
then his mother handed him the large broom and with this he worked hard to make a way to the door
he had to be careful to dig the snow well away or else as soon as the door was opened the whole soft mass would fall inside or if the frost was severe enough it would have made such a wall of ice in front of the house that no one could have gone in or out for the window was only big enough for peter to creep through
the fresh snow froze like this in the night sometimes and this was an enjoyable time for peter for he would get through the window on to the hard smooth frozen ground and his mother would hand him out the little sleigh and he could then make his descent to dorfli along any route he chose for the whole mountain was nothing but one wide unbroken sleigh road
almuncle had kept his word and was not spending the winter in his old home
as soon as the first snow began to fall he had shut up the hut and the outside buildings and gone down to dorfli with heidi and the goats
near the church was a straggling halfruined building which had once been the house of a person of consequence
a distinguished soldier had lived there at one time he had taken service in spain and had there performed many brave deeds and gathered much treasure
when he returned home to dorfli he spent part of his booty in building a fine house with the intention of living in it
but he had been too long accustomed to the noise and bustle of arms and the world to care for a quiet country life and he soon went off again and this time did not return
when after many long years it seemed certain that he was dead a distant relative took possession of the house but it had already fallen into disrepair and he had no wish to rebuild it
so it was let to poor people who paid but a small rent and when any part of the building fell it was allowed to remain
this had now gone on for many years
as long ago as when his son tobias was a child almuncle had rented the tumble down old place
since then it had stood empty for no one could stay in it who had not some idea of how to stop up the holes and gaps and make it habitable
otherwise the wind and rain and snow blew into the rooms so that it was impossible even to keep a candle alight and the indwellers would have been frozen to death during the long cold winters
almuncle however knew how to mend matters
as soon as he made up his mind to spend the winter in dorfli he rented the old place and worked during the autumn to get it sound and tight
in the middle of october he and heidi took up their residence there
on approaching the house from the back one came first into an open space with a wall on either side of which one was half in ruins
above this rose the arch of an old window thickly overgrown with ivy which spread over the remains of a domed roof that had evidently been part of a chapel
a large hall came next which lay open without doors to the square outside
here also walls and roof only partially remained and indeed what was left of the roof looked as if it might fall at any minute had it not been for two stout pillars that supported it
almuncle had here put up a wooden partition and covered the floor with straw for this was to be the goats house
endless passages led from this through the rents of which the sky as well as the fields and the road outside could be seen at intervals but at last one came to a stout oak door that led into a room that still stood intact
here the walls and the dark wainscoting remained as good as ever and in the corner was an immense stove reaching nearly to the ceiling on the white tiles of which were painted large pictures in blue
these represented old castles surrounded with trees and huntsmen riding out with their hounds or else a quiet lake scene with broad oak trees and a man fishing
a seat ran all round the stove so that one could sit at ones ease and study the pictures
these attracted heidis attention at once and she had no sooner arrived with her grandfather than she ran and seated herself and began to examine them
but when she had gradually worked herself round to the back something else diverted her attention
in the large space between the stove and the wall four planks had been put together as if to make a large receptacle for apples there were no apples however inside but something heidi had no difficulty in recognising for it was her very own bed with its hay mattress and sheets and sack for a coverlid just as she had it up at the hut
heidi clapped her hands for joy and exclaimed o grandfather this is my room how nice
but where are you going to sleep
your room must be near the stove or you will freeze he replied but you can come and see mine too
heidi got down and skipped across the large room after her grandfather who opened a door at the farther end leading into a smaller one which was to be his bedroom
then came another door
heidi pushed it open and stood amazed for here was an immense room like a kitchen larger than anything of the kind that heidi had seen before
there was still plenty of work for the grandfather before this room could be finished for there were holes and cracks in the walls through which the wind whistled and yet he had already nailed up so many new planks that it looked as if a lot of small cupboards had been set up round the room
he had however made the large old door safe with many screws and nails as a protection against the outside air and this was very necessary for just beyond was a mass of ruined buildings overgrown with tall weeds which made a dwellingplace for endless beetles and lizards
heidi was very delighted with her new home and by the morning after their arrival she knew every nook and corner so thoroughly that she could take peter over it and show him all that was to be seen indeed she would not let him go till he had examined every single wonderful thing contained in it
heidi slept soundly in her corner by the stove but every morning when she first awoke she still thought she was on the mountain and that she must run outside at once to see if the fir trees were so quiet because their branches were weighed down with the thick snow
she had to look about her for some minutes before she felt quite sure where she was and a certain sensation of trouble and oppression would come over her as she grew aware that she was not at home in the hut
but then she would hear her grandfathers voice outside attending to the goats and these would give one or two loud bleats as if calling to her to make haste and go to them and then heidi was happy again for she knew she was still at home and she would jump gladly out of bed and run out to the animals as quickly as she could
on the fourth morning as soon as she saw her grandfather she said i must go up to see grandmother today she ought not to be alone so long
but the grandfather would not agree to this
neither today nor tomorrow can you go he said the mountain is covered fathom deep in snow and the snow is still falling the sturdy peter can hardly get along
a little creature like you would soon be smothered by it and we should not be able to find you again
wait a bit till it freezes then you will be able to walk over the hard snow
heidi did not like the thought of having to wait but the days were so busy that she hardly knew how they went by
heidi now went to school in dorfli every morning and afternoon and eagerly set to work to learn all that was taught her
she hardly ever saw peter there for as a rule he was absent
the teacher was an easygoing man who merely remarked now and then peter is not turning up today again it seems but there is a lot of snow up on the mountain and i daresay he cannot get along
peter however always seemed able to make his way through the snow in the evening when school was over and he then generally paid heidi a visit
at last after some days the sun again appeared and shone brightly over the white ground but he went to bed again behind the mountains at a very early hour as if he did not find such pleasure in looking down on the earth as when everything was green and flowery
but then the moon came out clear and large and lit up the great white snowfield all through the night and the next morning the whole mountain glistened and sparkled like a huge crystal
when peter got out of his window as usual he was taken by surprise for instead of sinking into the soft snow he fell on the hard ground and went sliding some way down the mountain side like a sleigh before he could stop himself
he picked himself up and tested the hardness of the ground by stamping on it and trying with all his might to dig his heels into it but even then he could not break off a single little splinter of ice the alm was frozen hard as iron
this was just what peter had been hoping for as he knew now that heidi would be able to come up to them
he quickly got back into the house swallowed the milk which his mother had put ready for him thrust a piece of bread in his pocket and said i must be off to school
thats right go and learn all you can said the grandmother encouragingly
peter crept through the window again the door was quite blocked by the frozen snow outsidepulling his little sleigh after him and in another minute was shooting down the mountain
he went like lightning and when he reached dorfli which stood on the direct road to mayenfeld he made up his mind to go on further for he was sure he could not stop his rapid descent without hurting himself and the sleigh too
so down he still went till he reached the level ground where the sleigh came to a pause of its own accord
then he got out and looked round
the impetus with which he had made his journey down had carried him some little way beyond mayenfeld
he bethought himself that it was too late to get to school now as lessons would already have begun and it would take him a good hour to walk back to dorfli
so he might take his time about returning which he did and reached dorfli just as heidi had got home from school and was sitting at dinner with her grandfather
peter walked in and as on this occasion he had something particular to communicate he began without a pause exclaiming as he stood still in the middle of the room shes got it now
got it
asked the uncle
your words sound quite warlike general
the frost explained peter
then now i can go and see grandmother
said heidi joyfully for she had understood peters words at once
but why were you not at school then
you could have come down in the sleigh she added reproachfully for it did not agree with heidis ideas of good behavior to stay away when it was possible to be there
it carried me on too far and i was too late peter replied
i call that being a deserter said the uncle and deserters get their ears pulled as you know
peter gave a tug to his cap in alarm for there was no one of whom he stood in so much awe as almuncle
and an army leader like yourself ought to be doubly ashamed of running away continued almuncle
what would you think of your goats if one went off this way and another that and refused to follow and do what was good for them
what would you do then
i should beat them said peter promptly
and if a boy behaved like these unruly goats and he got a beating for it what would you say then
serve him right was the answer
good then understand this next time you let your sleigh carry you past the school when you ought to be inside at your lessons come on to me afterwards and receive what you deserve
peter now understood the drift of the old mans questions and that he was the boy who behaved like the unruly goats and he looked somewhat fearfully towards the corner to see if anything happened to be there such as he used himself on such occasions for the punishment of his animals
but now the grandfather suddenly said in a cheerful voice come and sit down and have something and afterwards heidi shall go with you
bring her back this evening and you will find supper waiting for you here
this unexpected turn of conversation set peter grinning all over with delight
he obeyed without hesitation and took his seat beside heidi
but the child could not eat any more in her excitement at the thought of going to see grandmother
she pushed the potatoes and toasted cheese which still stood on her plate towards him while uncle was filling his plate from the other side so that he had quite a pile of food in front of him but he attacked it without any lack of courage
heidi ran to the cupboard and brought out the warm cloak clara had sent her with this on and the hood drawn over her head she was all ready for her journey
she stood waiting beside peter and as soon as his last mouthful had disappeared she said come along now
as the two walked together heidi had much to tell peter of her two goats that had been so unhappy the first day in their new stall that they would not eat anything but stood hanging their heads not even rousing themselves to bleat
and when she asked her grandfather the reason of this he told her it was with them as with her in frankfurt for it was the first time in their lives they had come down from the mountain
and you dont know what that is peter unless you have felt it yourself added heidi
the children had nearly reached their destination before peter opened his mouth he appeared to be so sunk in thought that he hardly heard what was said to him
as they neared home however he stood still and said in a somewhat sullen voice i had rather go to school even than get what uncle threatened
heidi was of the same mind and encouraged him in his good intention
they found brigitta sitting alone knitting for the grandmother was not very well and had to stay the day in bed on account of the cold
heidi had never before missed the old figure in her place in the corner and she ran quickly into the next room
there lay grandmother on her little poorly covered bed wrapped up in her warm grey shawl
thank god she exclaimed as heidi came running in the poor old woman had had a secret fear at heart all through the autumn especially if heidi was absent for any length of time for peter had told her of a strange gentleman who had come from frankfurt and who had gone out with them and always talked to heidi and she had felt sure he had come to take her away again
even when she heard he had gone off alone she still had an idea that a messenger would be sent over from frankfurt to fetch the child
heidi went up to the side of the bed and said are you very ill grandmother
no no child answered the old woman reassuringly passing her hand lovingly over the childs head its only the frost that has got into my bones a bit
shall you be quite well then directly it turns warm again
yes god willing or even before that for i want to get back to my spinning i thought perhaps i should do a little today but tomorrow i am sure to be all right again
the old woman had detected that heidi was frightened and was anxious to set her mind at ease
her words comforted heidi who had in truth been greatly distressed for she had never before seen the grandmother ill in bed
she now looked at the old woman seriously for a minute or two and then said in frankfurt everybody puts on a shawl to go out walking did you think it was to be worn in bed grandmother
i put it on dear child to keep myself from freezing and i am so pleased with it for my bedclothes are not very thick she answered
but grandmother continued heidi your bed is not right because it goes downhill at your head instead of uphill
i know it child i can feel it and the grandmother put up her hand to the thin flat pillow which was little more than a board under her head to make herself more comfortable the pillow was never very thick and i have lain on it now for so many years that it has grown quite flat
oh if only i had asked clara to let me take away my frankfurt bed said heidi
i had three large pillows one above the other so that i could hardly sleep and i used to slip down to try and find a flat place and then i had to pull myself up again because it was proper to sleep there like that
could you sleep like that grandmother
oh yes
the pillows keep one warm and it is easier to breathe when the head is high answered the grandmother wearily raising her head as she spoke as if trying to find a higher restingplace
but we will not talk about that for i have so much that other old sick people are without for which i thank god there is the nice bread i get every day and this warm wrap and your visits heidi
will you read me something today
heidi ran into the next room to fetch the hymn book
then she picked out the favorite hymns one after another for she knew them all by heart now as pleased as the grandmother to hear them again after so many days
the grandmother lay with folded hands while a smile of peace stole over the worn troubled face like one to whom good news has been brought
suddenly heidi paused
grandmother are you feeling quite well again already
yes child i have grown better while listening to you read it to the end
the child read on and when she came to the last words as the eyes grow dim and darkness closes round the soul grows clearer sees the goal to which it travels gladly feels its home is nearer
the grandmother repeated them once or twice to herself with a look of happy expectation on her face
and heidi took equal pleasure in them for the picture of the beautiful sunny day of her return home rose before her eyes and she exclaimed joyfully grandmother i know exactly what it is like to go home
the old woman did not answer but she had heard heidis words and the expression that had made the child think she was better remained on her face
a little later heidi said it is growing dark and i must go home i am glad to think that you are quite well again
the grandmother took the childs hand in hers and held it closely
yes she said i feel quite happy again even if i have to go on lying here i am content
no one knows what it is to lie here alone day after day in silence and darkness without hearing a voice or seeing a ray of light
sad thoughts come over me and i do not feel sometimes as if i could bear it any longer or as if it could ever be light again
but when you come and read those words to me then i am comforted and my heart rejoices once more
then she let the child go and heidi ran into the next room and bid peter come quickly for it had now grown quite dark
but when they got outside they found the moon shining down on the white snow and everything as clear as in the daylight
peter got his sleigh put heidi at the back he himself sitting in front to guide and down the mountain they shot like two birds darting through the air
when heidi was lying that night on her high bed of hay she thought of the grandmother on her low pillow and of all she had said about the light and comfort that awoke in her when she heard the hymns and she thought if i could read to her every day then i should go on making her better
but she knew that it would be a week if not two before she would be able to go up the mountain again
this was a thought of great trouble to heidi and she tried hard to think of some way which would enable the grandmother to hear the words she loved every day
suddenly an idea struck her and she was so delighted with it that she could hardly bear to wait for morning so eager was she to begin carrying out her plan
all at once she sat upright in her bed for she had been so busy with her thoughts that she had forgotten to say her prayers and she never now finished her day without saying them
when she had prayed with all her heart for herself her grandfather and grandmother she lay back again on the warm soft hay and slept soundly and peacefully till morning broke
peter arrived punctually at school the following day
he had brought his dinner with him for all the children who lived at a distance regularly seated themselves at midday on the tables and resting their feet firmly on the benches spread out their meal on their knees and so ate their dinner while those living in dorfli went home for theirs
till one oclock they might all do as they liked and then school began again
when peter had finished his lessons on the days he attended school he went over to uncles to see heidi
when he walked into the large room at uncles today heidi immediately rushed forward and took hold of him for it was for peter she had been waiting
ive thought of something peter she said hastily
you must learn to read she informed him
i have learnt was the answer
yes yes but i mean so that you can really make use of it continued heidi eagerly
i never shall was the prompt reply
nobody believes that you cannot learn nor i either now said heidi in a very decided tone of voice
grandmamma in frankfurt said long ago that it was not true and she told me not to believe you
peter looked rather taken aback at this piece of intelligence
i will soon teach you to read for i know how continued heidi
you must learn at once and then you can read one or two hymns every day to grandmother
oh i dont care about that he grumbled in reply
this hardhearted way of refusing to agree to what was right and kind and to what heidi had so much at heart aroused her anger
with flashing eyes she stood facing the boy and said threateningly if you wont learn as i want you to i will tell you what will happen you know your mother has often spoken of sending you to frankfurt that you may learn a lot of things and i know where the boys there have to go to school clara pointed out the great house to me when we were driving together
and they dont only go when they are boys but have more lessons still when they are grown men
i have seen them myself and you mustnt think they have only one kind teacher like we have
there are ever so many of them all in the school at the same time and they are all dressed in black as if they were going to church and have black hats on their heads as high as that and heidi held out her hand to show their height from the floor
peter felt a cold shudder run down his back
and you will have to go in among all those gentlemen continued heidi with increasing animation and when it comes to your turn you wont be able to read and will make mistakes in your spelling
then youll see how theyll make fun of you even worse than tinette and you ought to have seen what she was like when she was scornful
well ill learn then said peter half sorrowfully and half angrily
heidi was instantly mollified
thats right then well begin at once she said cheerfully and went busily to work on the spot dragging peter to the table and fetching her books
among other presents clara had sent heidi a book which the latter had decided in bed the night before would serve capitally for teaching peter for it was an a b c book with rhyming lines
and now the two sat together at the table with their heads bent over the book for the lesson had begun
peter was made to spell out the first sentence two or three times over for heidi wished him to get it correct and fluent
at last she said you dont seem able to get it right but i will read it aloud to you once when you know what it ought to be you will find it easier
and she read out a b c must be learnt today or the judge will call you up to pay
i shant go said peter obstinately
go where
before the judge he answered
well then make haste and learn these three letters then you wont have to go
peter went at his task again and repeated the three letters so many times and with such determination that she said at last you must know those three now
seeing what an effect the first two lines of verse had had upon him she thought she would prepare the ground a little for the following lessons
wait and i will read you some of the next sentences she continued then you will see what else there is to expect
and she began in a clear slow voice d e f g must run with ease or something will follow that does not please
should h i j k be now forgot disgrace is yours upon the spot
and then l m must follow at once or punished youll be for a sorry dunce
if you knew what next awaited you youd haste to learn n o p q
now r s t be quick about or worse will follow theres little doubt
heidi paused for peter was so quiet that she looked to see what he was doing
these many secret threats and hints of dreadful punishments had so affected him that he sat as if petrified and stared at heidi with horrorstricken eyes
her kind heart was moved at once and she said wishing to reassure him you need not be afraid peter come here to me every evening and if you learn as you have today you will at last know all your letters and the other things wont come
but you must come regularly not now and then as you do to school even if it snows it wont hurt you
peter promised for the trepidation he had been in had made him quite tame and docile
lessons being finished for this day he now went home
peter obeyed heidis instructions punctually and every evening went diligently to work to learn the following letters taking the sentences thoroughly to heart
the grandfather was frequently in the room smoking his pipe comfortably while the lesson was going on and his face twitched occasionally as if he was overtaken with a sudden fit of merriment
peter was often invited to stay to supper after the great exertion he had gone through which richly compensated him for the anguish of mind he had suffered with the sentence for the day
so the winter went by and peter really made progress with his letters but he went through a terrible fight each day with the sentences
he had got at last to u
heidi read out and if you put the u for v youll go where you would not like to be
peter growled yes but i shant go
but he was very diligent that day as if under the impression that some one would seize him suddenly by the collar and drag him where he would rather not go
the next evening heidi read if you falter at w worst of all look at the stick against the wall
peter looked at the wall and said scornfully there isnt one
yes but do you know what grandfather has in his box
a stick as thick almost as your arm and if he took that out you might well say look at the stick on the wall
peter knew that thick hazel stick and immediately bent his head over the w and struggled to master it
another day the lines ran then comes the x for you to say or be sure youll get no food today
peter looked towards the cupboard where the bread and cheese were kept and said crossly i never said that i should forget the x
thats all right if you dont forget it we can go on to learn the next and then you will only have one more replied heidi anxious to encourage him
peter did not quite understand but when heidi went on and read and should you make a stop at y theyll point at you and cry fie fie
all the gentlemen in frankfurt with tall black hats on their heads and scorn and mockery in their faces rose up before his minds eye and he threw himself with energy on the y not letting it go till at last he knew it so thoroughly that he could see what it was like even when he shut his eyes
he arrived on the following day in a somewhat lofty frame of mind for there was now only one letter to struggle over and when heidi began the lesson with reading aloud make haste with z if youre too slow off to the hottentots youll go
peter remarked scornfully i dare say when no one knows even where such people live
i assure you peter replied heidi grandfather knows all about them
wait a second and i will run and ask him for he is only over the way with the pastor
and she rose and ran to the door to put her words into action but peter cried out in a voice of agony stop
for he already saw himself being carried off by alm uncle and the pastor and sent straight away to the hottentots since as yet he did not know his last letter
his cry of fear brought heidi back
she asked in astonishment
nothing
come back
i am going to learn my letter he said stammering with fear
heidi however herself wished to know where the hottentots lived and persisted that she should ask her grandfather but she gave in at last to peters despairing entreaties
she insisted on his doing something in return and so not only had he to repeat his z until it was so fixed in his memory that he could never forget it again but she began teaching him to spell and peter really made a good start that evening
so it went on from day to day
the frost had gone and the snow was soft again and moreover fresh snow continually fell so that it was quite three weeks before heidi could go to the grandmother again
so much the more eagerly did she pursue her teaching so that peter might compensate for her absence by reading hymns to the old woman
one evening he walked in home after leaving heidi and as he entered he said i can do it now
do what peter
asked his mother
read he answered
do you really mean it
did you hear that grandmother
she called out
the grandmother had heard and was already wondering how such a thing could have come to pass
i must read one of the hymns now heidi told me to he went on to inform them
his mother hastily fetched the book and the grandmother lay in joyful expectation for it was so long since she had heard the good words
peter sat down to the table and began to read
his mother sat beside him listening with surprise and exclaiming at the close of each verse who would have thought it possible
the grandmother did not speak though she followed the words he read with strained attention
it happened on the day following this that there was a reading lesson in peters class
when it came to his turn the teacher said we must pass over peter as usual or will you try again once morei will not say to read but to stammer through a sentence
peter took the book and read off three lines without the slightest hesitation
the teacher put down his book and stared at peter as at some out oftheway and marvellous thing unseen before
at last he spoke peter some miracle has been performed upon you
here have i been striving with unheardof patience to teach you and you have not hitherto been able to say your letters even
and now just as i had made up my mind not to waste any more trouble upon you you suddenly are able to read a consecutive sentence properly and distinctly
how has such a miracle come to pass in our days
it was heidi answered peter
the teacher looked in astonishment towards heidi who was sitting innocently on her bench with no appearance of anything supernatural about her
he continued i have noticed a change in you altogether peter
whereas formerly you often missed coming to school for a week or even weeks at a time you have lately not stayed away a single day
who has wrought this change for good in you
it was uncle answered peter
with increasing surprise the teacher looked from peter to heidi and back again at peter
we will try once more he said cautiously and peter had again to show off his accomplishment by reading another three lines
there was no mistake about itpeter could read
as soon as school was over the teacher went over to the pastor to tell him this piece of news and to inform him of the happy result of heidis and the grandfathers combined efforts
every evening peter read one hymn aloud so far he obeyed heidi
nothing would induce him to read a second and indeed the grandmother never asked for it
his mother brigitta could not get over her surprise at her sons attainment and when the reader was in bed would often express her pleasure at it
now he has learnt to read there is no knowing what may be made of him yet
on one of these occasions the grandmother answered yes it is good for him to have learnt something but i shall indeed be thankful when spring is here again and heidi can come they are not like the same hymns when peter reads them
so many words seem missing and i try to think what they ought to be and then i lose the sense and so the hymns do not come home to my heart as when heidi reads them
the truth was that peter arranged to make his reading as little troublesome for himself as possible
when he came upon a word that he thought was too long or difficult in any other way he left it out for he decided that a word or two less in a verse where there were so many of them could make no difference to his grandmother
and so it came about that most of the principal words were missing in the hymns that peter read aloud
it was the month of may
from every height the full fresh streams of spring were flowing down into the valley
the clear warm sunshine lay upon the mountain which had turned green again
the last snows had disappeared and the sun had already coaxed many of the flowers to show their bright heads above the grass
up above the gay young wind of spring was singing through the fir trees and shaking down the old dark needles to make room for the new bright green ones that were soon to deck out the trees in their spring finery
higher up still the great bird went circling round in the blue ether as of old while the golden sunshine lit up the grandfathers hut and all the ground about it was warm and dry again so that one might sit out where one liked
heidi was at home again on the mountain running backwards and forwards in her accustomed way not knowing which spot was most delightful
now she stood still to listen to the deep mysterious voice of the wind as it blew down to her from the mountain summits coming nearer and nearer and gathering strength as it came till it broke with force against the fir trees bending and shaking them and seeming to shout for joy so that she too though blown about like a feather felt she must join in the chorus of exulting sounds
then she would run round again to the sunny space in front of the hut and seating herself on the ground would peer closely into the short grass to see how many little flower cups were open or thinking of opening
she rejoiced with all the myriad little beetles and winged insects that jumped and crawled and danced in the sun and drew in deep draughts of the spring scents that rose from the newlyawakened earth and thought the mountain was more beautiful than ever
all the tiny living creatures must be as happy as she for it seemed to her there were little voices all round her singing and humming in joyful tones on the mountain
on the mountain
from the shed at the back came the sound of sawing and chopping and heidi listened to it with pleasure for it was the old familiar sound she had known from the beginning of her life up here
suddenly she jumped up and ran round for she must know what her grandfather was doing
in front of the shed door already stood a finished new chair and a second was in course of construction under the grandfathers skilful hand
oh i know what these are for exclaimed heidi in great glee
we shall want them when they all come from frankfurt
this one is for grandmamma and the one you are now making is for clara and thenthen there will i suppose have to be another continued heidi with more hesitation in her voice or do you think grandfather that perhaps fraulein rottenmeier will not come with them
well i cannot say just yet replied her grandfather but it will be safer to make one so that we can offer her a seat if she does
heidi looked thoughtfully at the plain wooden chair without arms as if trying to imagine how fraulein rottenmeier and a chair of this sort would suit one another
after a few minutes contemplation grandfather she said shaking her head doubtfully i dont think she would be able to sit on that
then we will invite her on the couch with the beautiful green turf featherbed was her grandfathers quiet rejoinder
while heidi was pausing to consider what this might be there approached from above a whistling calling and other sounds which heidi immediately recognised
she ran out and found herself surrounded by her fourfooted friends
they were apparently as pleased as she was to be among the heights again for they leaped about and bleated for joy pushing heidi this way and that each anxious to express his delight with some sign of affection
but peter sent them flying to right and left for he had something to give to heidi
when he at last got up to her he handed her a letter
there
he exclaimed leaving the further explanation of the matter to heidi herself
did some one give you this while you were out with the goats she asked in her surprise
no was the answer
where did you get it from then
i found it in the dinner bag
which was true to a certain extent
the letter to heidi had been given him the evening before by the postman at dorfli and peter had put it into his empty bag
that morning he had stuffed his bread and cheese on the top of it and had forgotten it when he fetched almuncles two goats only when he had finished his bread and cheese at midday and was searching in the bag for any last crumbs did he remember the letter which lay at the bottom
heidi read the address carefully then she ran back to the shed holding out her letter to her grandfather in high glee
from frankfurt
from clara
would you like to hear it
the grandfather was ready and pleased to do so as also peter who had followed heidi into the shed
he leant his back against the door post as he felt he could follow heidis reading better if firmly supported from behind and so stood prepared to listen
dearest heidi everything is packed and we shall start now in two or three days as soon as papa himself is ready to leave he is not coming with us as he has first to go to paris
the doctor comes every day and as soon as he is inside the door he cries off now as quickly as you can off to the mountain
he is most impatient about our going
you cannot think how much he enjoyed himself when he was with you
he has called nearly every day this winter and each time he has come in to my room and said he must tell me about everything again
and then he sits down and describes all he did with you and the grandfather and talks of the mountains and the flowers and of the great silence up there far above all towns and the villages and of the fresh delicious air and often adds no one can help getting well up there
he himself is quite a different man since his visit and looks quite young again and happy which he had not been for a long time before
oh how i am looking forward to seeing everything and to being with you on the mountain and to making the acquaintance of peter and the goats
i shall have first to go through a six weeks cure at ragatz this the doctor has ordered and then we shall move up to dorfli and every fine day i shall be carried up the mountain in my chair and spend the day with you
grandmamma is travelling with me and will remain with me she also is delighted at the thought of paying you a visit
but just imagine fraulein rottenmeier refuses to come with us
almost every day grandmamma says to her well how about this swiss journey my worthy rottenmeier
pray say if you really would like to come with us
but she always thanks grandmamma very politely and says she has quite made up her mind
i think i know what has done it sebastian gave such a frightful description of the mountain of how the rocks were so overhanging and dangerous that at any minute you might fall into a crevasse and how it was such steep climbing that you feared at every step to go slipping to the bottom and that goats alone could make their way up without fear of being killed
she shuddered when she heard him tell of all this and since then she has not been so enthusiastic about switzerland as she was before
fear has also taken possession of tinette and she also refuses to come
so grandmamma and i will be alone sebastian will go with us as far as ragatz and then return here
i can hardly bear waiting till i see you again
goodbye dearest heidi grandmamma sends you her best love and all good wishes
your affectionate friend clara
peter as soon as the conclusion of the letter had been reached left his reclining position and rushed out twirling his stick in the air in such a reckless fashion that the frightened goats fled down the mountain before him with higher and wider leaps than usual
peter followed at full speed his stick still raised in air in a menacing manner as if he was longing to vent his fury on some invisible foe
this foe was indeed the prospect of the arrival of the frankfurt visitors the thought of whom filled him with exasperation
heidi was so full of joyful anticipation that she determined to seize the first possible moment next day to go down and tell grandmother who was coming and also particularly who was not coming
these details would be of great interest to her for grandmother knew well all the persons named from heidis description and had entered with deep sympathy into all that the child had told her of her life and surroundings in frankfurt
heidi paid her visit in the early afternoon for she could now go alone again the sun was bright in the heavens and the days were growing longer and it was delightful to go racing down the mountain over the dry ground with the brisk may wind blowing from behind and speeding heidi on her way a little more quickly than her legs alone would have carried her
the grandmother was no longer confined to her bed
she was back in her corner at her spinningwheel but there was an expression on her face of mournful anxiety
peter had come in the evening before brimful of anger and had told about the large party who were coming up from frankfurt and he did not know what other things might happen after that and the old woman had not slept all night pursued by the old thought of heidi being taken from her
heidi ran in and taking her little stool immediately sat down by grandmother and began eagerly pouring out all her news growing more excited with her pleasure as she went on
but all of a sudden she stopped short and said anxiously what is the matter grandmother arent you a bit pleased with what i am telling you
yes yes of course child since it gives you so much pleasure she answered trying to look more cheerful
but i can see all the same that something troubles you
is it because you think after all that fraulein rottenmeier may come
asked heidi beginning to feel anxious herself
no no
it is nothing child said the grandmother wishing to reassure her
just give me your hand that i may feel sure you are there
no doubt it would be the best thing for you although i feel i could scarcely survive it
i do not want anything of the best if you could scarcely survive it said heidi in such a determined tone of voice that the grandmothers fears increased as she felt sure the people from frankfurt were coming to take heidi back with them since now she was well again they naturally wished to have her with them once more
but she was anxious to hide her trouble from heidi if possible as the latter was so sympathetic that she might refuse perhaps to go away and that would not be right
she sought for help but not for long for she knew of only one
heidi she said there is something that would comfort me and calm my thoughts read me the hymn beginning all things will work for good
heidi found the place at once and read out in her clear young voice all things will work for good to those who trust in me i come with healing on my wings to save and set thee free
yes yes that is just what i wanted to hear said the grandmother and the deep expression of trouble passed from her face
heidi looked at her thoughtfully for a minute or two and then said healing means that which cures everything and makes everybody well doesnt it grandmother
yes that is it replied the old woman with a nod of assent and we may be sure everything will come to pass according to gods good purpose
read the verse again that we may remember it well and not forget it again
and heidi read the words over two or three times for she also found pleasure in this assurance of all things being arranged for the best
when the evening came heidi returned home up the mountain
the stars came out overhead one by one so bright and sparkling that each seemed to send a fresh ray of joy into her heart she was obliged to pause continually to look up and as the whole sky at last grew spangled with them she spoke aloud yes i understand now why we feel so happy and are not afraid about anything because god knows what is good and beautiful for us
and the stars with their glistening eyes continued to nod to her till she reached home where she found her grandfather also standing and looking up at them for they had seldom been more glorious than they were this night
not only were the nights of this month of may so clear and bright but the days as well the sun rose every morning into the cloudless sky as undimmed in its splendor as when it sank the evening before and the grandfather would look out early and exclaim with astonishment this is indeed a wonderful year of sun it will make all the shrubs and plants grow apace you will have to see general that your army does not get out of hand from overfeeding
and peter would swing his stick with an air of assurance and an expression on his face as much as to say see to that
so may passed everything growing greener and greener and then came the month of june with a hotter sun and long light days that brought the flowers out all over the mountain so that every spot was bright with them and the air full of their sweet scents
this month too was drawing to its close when one day heidi having finished her domestic duties ran out with the intention of paying first a visit to the fir trees and then going up higher to see if the bush of rock roses was yet in bloom for its flowers were so lovely when standing open in the sun
but just as she was turning the corner of the hut she gave such a loud cry that her grandfather came running out of the shed to see what had happened
grandfather grandfather
she cried beside herself with excitement
come here
look
the old man was by her side by this time and looked in the direction of her outstretched hand
a strange looking procession was making its way up the mountain in front were two men carrying a sedan chair in which sat a girl well wrapped up in shawls then followed a horse mounted by a statelylooking lady who was looking about her with great interest and talking to the guide who walked beside her then a reclining chair which was being pushed up by another man it having evidently been thought safer to send the invalid to whom it belonged up the steep path in a sedan chair
the procession wound up with a porter with such a bundle of cloaks shawls and furs on his back that it rose well above his head
here they come
shouted heidi jumping with joy
and sure enough it was the party from frankfurt the figures came nearer and nearer and at last they had actually arrived
the men in front put down their burden heidi rushed forward and the two children embraced each other with mutual delight
grandmamma having also reached the top dismounted and gave heidi an affectionate greeting before turning to the grandfather who had meanwhile come up to welcome his guests
there was no constraint about the meeting for they both knew each other perfectly well from hearsay and felt like old acquaintances
after the first words of greeting had been exchanged grandmamma broke out into lively expressions of admiration
what a magnificent residence you have uncle
i could hardly have believed it was so beautiful
a king might well envy you
and how well my little heidi lookslike a wild rose
she continued drawing the child towards her and stroking her fresh pink cheeks
i dont know which way to look first it is all so lovely
what do you say to it clara what do you say
clara was gazing round entranced she had never imagined much less seen anything so beautiful
she gave vent to her delight in cries of joy
o grandmamma she said i should like to remain here for ever
the grandfather had meanwhile drawn up the invalid chair and spread some of the wraps over it he now went up to clara
supposing we carry the little daughter now to her accustomed chair i think she will be more comfortable the travelling sedan is rather hard he said and without waiting for any one to help him he lifted the child in his strong arms and laid her gently down on her own couch
he then covered her over carefully and arranged her feet on the soft cushion as if he had never done anything all his life but attend on cripples
the grandmamma looked on with surprise
my dear uncle she exclaimed if i knew where you had learned to nurse i would at once send all the nurses i know to the same place that they might handle their patients in like manner
how do you come to know so much
uncle smiled
i know more from experience than training he answered but as he spoke the smile died away and a look of sadness passed over his face
the vision rose before him of a face of suffering that he had known long years before the face of a man lying crippled on his couch of pain and unable to move a limb
the man had been his captain during the fierce fighting in sicily he had found him lying wounded and had carried him away and after that the captain would suffer no one else near him and uncle had stayed and nursed him till his sufferings ended in death
it all came back to uncle now and it seemed natural to him to attend on the sick clara and to show her all those kindly attentions with which he had been once so familiar
the sky spread blue and cloudless over the hut and the fir trees and far above over the high rocks the grey summits of which glistened in the sun
clara could not feast her eyes enough on all the beauty around her
o heidi if only i could walk about with you she said longingly if i could but go and look at the fir trees and at everything i know so well from your description although i have never been here before
heidi in response put out all her strength and after a slight effort managed to wheel claras chair quite easily round the hut to the fir trees
there they paused
clara had never seen such trees before with their tall straight stems and long thick branches growing thicker and thicker till they touched the ground
even the grandmamma who had followed the children was astonished at the sight of them
she hardly knew what to admire most in these ancient trees the lofty tops rising in their full green splendor towards the sky or the pillarlike stems with their straight and gigantic boughs that spoke of such antiquity of age of such long years during which they had looked down upon the valley below where men came and went and all things were continually changing while they stood undisturbed and changeless
heidi had now wheeled clara on to the goat shed and had flung open the door so that clara might have a full view of all that was inside
there was not much to see just now as its indwellers were absent
clara lamented to her grandmother that they would have to leave early before the goats came home
i should so like to have seen peter and his whole flock
dear child let us enjoy all the beautiful things that we can see and not think about those that we cannot grandmamma replied as she followed the chair which heidi was pushing further on
oh the flowers
look at the bushes of red flowers and all the nodding blue bells
oh if i could but get up and pick some
heidi ran off at once and picked her a large nosegay of them
but these are nothing clara she said laying the flowers on her lap
if you could come up higher to where the goats are feeding then you would indeed see something
bushes on bushes of the red centaury and ever so many more of the blue bell flowers and then the bright yellow rock roses that gleam like pure gold and all crowding together in the one spot
and then there are others with the large leaves that grandfather calls bright eyes and the brown ones with little round heads that smell so delicious
oh it is beautiful up there and if you sit down among them you never want to get up again everything looks and smells so lovely
heidis eyes sparkled with the remembrance of what she was describing she was longing herself to see it all again and clara caught her enthusiasm and looked back at her with equal longing in her soft blue eyes
grandmamma do you think i could get up there
is it possible for me to go
she asked eagerly
if only i could walk climb about everywhere with you heidi
i am sure i could push you up the chair goes so easily said heidi and in proof of her words she sent the chair at such a pace round the corner that it nearly went flying down the mountainside
grandmamma being at hand however stopped it in time
the grandfather meantime had not been idle
he had by this time put the table and extra chairs in front of the seat so that they might all sit out here and eat the dinner that was preparing inside
the milk and the cheese were soon ready and then the company sat down in high spirits to their midday meal
grandmamma was enchanted as the doctor had been with their diningroom whence one could see far along the valley and far over the mountains to the farthest stretch of blue sky
a light wind blew refreshingly over them as they sat at table and the rustling of the fir trees made a festive accompaniment to the repast
i never enjoyed anything as much as this
it is really superb
cried grandmamma two or three times over and then suddenly in a tone of surprise do i really see you taking a second piece of toasted cheese clara
there sure enough was a second goldencolored slice of cheese on claras plate
oh it does taste so nice grandmammabetter than all the dishes we have at ragatz replied clara as she continued eating with appetite
thats right eat what you can
exclaimed uncle
its the mountain air which makes up for the deficiencies of the kitchen
and so the meal went on
grandmamma and almuncle got on very well together and their conversation became more and more lively
they were so thoroughly agreed in their opinions of men and things and the world in general that they might have been taken for old cronies
the time passed merrily and then grandmamma looked towards the west and said we must soon get ready to go clara the sun is a good way down the men will be here directly with the horse and sedan
claras face fell and she said beseechingly oh just another hour grandmamma or two hours
we havent seen inside the hut yet or heidis bed or any of the other things
if only the day was ten hours long
well that is not possible said grandmamma but she herself was anxious to see inside the hut so they all rose from the table and uncle wheeled claras chair to the door
but there they came to a standstill for the chair was much too broad to pass through the door
uncle however soon settled the difficulty by lifting clara in his strong arms and carrying her inside
grandmamma went all round and examined the household arrangements and was very much amused and pleased at their orderliness and the cozy appearance of everything
and this is your bedroom up here heidi is it not
she asked as without trepidation she mounted the ladder to the hay loft
oh it does smell sweet what a healthy place to sleep in
she went up to the round window and looked out and grandfather followed up with clara in his arms heidi springing up after them
then they all stood and examined heidis wonderful haybed and grandmamma looked thoughtfully at it and drew in from time to time fragrant draughts of the hayperfumed air while clara was charmed beyond words with heidis sleeping apartment
it is delightful for you up here heidi
you can look from your bed straight into the sky and then such a delicious smell all round you
and outside the fir trees waving and rustling
i have never seen such a pleasant cheerful bedroom before
uncle looked across at the grandmamma
i have been thinking he said to her that if you were willing to agree to it your little granddaughter might remain up here and i am sure she would grow stronger
you have brought up all kinds of shawls and covers with you and we could make up a soft bed out of them and as to the general looking after the child you need have no fear for i will see to that
clara and heidi were as overjoyed at these words as if they were two birds let out of their cages and grandmammas face beamed with satisfaction
you are indeed kind my dear uncle she exclaimed you give words to the thought that was in my own mind
i was only asking myself whether a stay up here might not be the very thing she wanted
but then the trouble the inconvenience to yourself
and you speak of nursing and looking after her as if it was a mere nothing
i thank you sincerely i thank you from my whole heart uncle
and she took his hand and gave it a long and grateful shake which he returned with a pleased expression of countenance
uncle immediately set to work to get things ready
he carried clara back to her chair outside heidi following not knowing how to jump high enough into the air to express her contentment
then he gathered up a whole pile of shawls and furs and said smiling it is a good thing that grandmamma came up well provided for a winters campaign we shall be able to make good use of these
foresight is a virtue responded the lady amused and prevents many misfortunes
if we have made the journey over your mountains without meeting with storms winds and cloudbursts we can only be thankful which we are and my provision against these disasters now comes in usefully as you say
the two had meanwhile ascended to the hayloft and begun to prepare a bed there were so many articles piled one over the other that when finished it looked like a regular little fortress
grandmamma passed her hand carefully over it to make sure there were no bits of hay sticking out
if theres a bit that can come through it will she said
the soft mattress however was so smooth and thick that nothing could penetrate it
then they went down again well satisfied and found the children laughing and talking together and arranging all they were going to do from morning till evening as long as clara stayed
the next question was how long she was to remain and first grandmamma was asked but she referred them to the grandfather who gave it as his opinion that she ought to make the trial of the mountain air for at least a month
the children clapped their hands for joy for they had not expected to be together for so long a time
the bearers and the horse and guide were now seen approaching the former were sent back at once and grandmamma prepared to mount for her return journey
its not saying goodbye grandmamma clara called out for you will come up now and then and see how we are getting on and we shall so look forward to your visits shant we heidi
heidi who felt that life this day had been crowded with pleasures could only respond to clara with another jump of joy
grandmamma being now seated on her sturdy animal uncle took the bridle to lead her down the steep mountain path she begged him not to come far with her but he insisted on seeing her safely as far as dorfli for the way was precipitous and not without danger for the rider he said
grandmamma did not care to stay alone in dorfli and therefore decided to return to ragatz and thence to make excursions up the mountain from time to time
peter came down with his goats before uncle had returned
as soon as the animals caught sight of heidi they all came flocking towards her and she as well as clara on her couch were soon surrounded by the goats pushing and poking their heads one over the other while heidi introduced each in turn by its name to her friend clara
it was not long before the latter had made the longwishedfor acquaintance of little snowflake the lively greenfinch and the wellbehaved goats belonging to grandfather as well as of the many others including the grand turk
peter meanwhile stood apart looking on and casting somewhat unfriendly glances towards clara
when the two children called out goodevening peter he made no answer but swung up his stick angrily as if wanting to cut the air in two and then ran off with his goats after him
the climax to all the beautiful things that clara had already seen upon the mountain came at the close of the day
as she lay on the large soft bed in the hay loft with heidi near her she looked out through the round open window right into the middle of the shining clusters of stars and she exclaimed in delight heidi its just as if we were in a high carriage and were going to drive straight into heaven
yes and do you know why the stars are so happy and look down and nod to us like that
no why is it
clara asked in return
because they live up in heaven and know how well god arranges everything for us so that we need have no more fear or trouble and may be quite sure that all things will come right in the end
thats why they are so happy and they nod to us because they want us to be happy too
but then we must never forget to pray and to ask god to remember us when he is arranging things so that we too may feel safe and have no anxiety about what is going to happen
the two children now sat up and said their prayers and then heidi put her head down on her little round arm and fell off to sleep at once but clara lay awake some time for she could not get over the wonder of this new experience of being in bed up here among the stars
she had indeed seldom seen a star for she never went outside the house at night and the curtains at home were always drawn before the stars came out
each time she closed her eyes she felt she must open them again to see if the two very large stars were still looking in and nodding to her as heidi said they did
there they were always in the same place and clara felt she could not look long enough into their bright sparkling faces until at last her eyes closed of their own accord and it was only in her dreams that she still saw the two large friendly stars shining down upon her
the sun had just risen above the mountains and was shedding its first golden rays over the hut and the valley below
almuncle as was his custom had been standing in a quiet and devout attitude for some little while watching the light mists gradually lifting and the heights and valley emerging from their twilight shadows and awakening to another day
the light morning clouds overhead grew brighter and brighter till at last the sun shone out in its full glory and rock and wood and hill lay bathed in golden light
uncle now stepped back into the hut and went softly up the ladder
clara had just opened her eyes and was looking with wonder at the bright sunlight that shone through the round window and danced and sparkled about her bed
she could not at first think what she was looking at or where she was
then she caught sight of heidi sleeping beside her and now she heard the grandfathers cheery voice asking her if she had slept well and was feeling rested
she assured him she was not tired and that when she had once fallen asleep she had not opened her eyes again all night
the grandfather was satisfied at this and immediately began to attend upon her with so much gentleness and understanding that it seemed as if his chief calling had been to look after sick children
heidi now awoke and was surprised to see clara dressed and already in the grandfathers arms ready to be carried down
she must be up too and she went through her toilette with lightning like speed
she ran down the ladder and out of the hut and there further astonishment awaited her for grandfather had been busy the night before after they were in bed
seeing that it was impossible to get claras chair through the hutdoor he had taken down two of the boards at the side of the shed and made an opening large enough to admit the chair these he left loose so that they could be taken away and put up at pleasure
he was at this moment wheeling clara out into the sun he left her in front of the hut while he went to look after the goats and heidi ran up to her friend
the fresh morning breeze blew round the childrens faces and every fresh puff brought a waft of fragrance from the fir trees
clara drew it in with delight and lay back in her chair with an unaccustomed feeling of health and comfort
it was the first time in her life that she had been out in the open country at this early hour and felt the fresh morning breeze and the pure mountain air was so cool and refreshing that every breath she drew was a pleasure
and then the bright sweet sun which was not hot and sultry up here but lay soft and warm on her hands and on the grass at her feet
clara had not imagined that it would be like this on the mountain
o heidi if only i could stay up here for ever with you she exclaimed happily turning in her chair from side to side that she might drink in the air and sun from all quarters
now you see that it is just what i told you replied heidi delighted that it is the most beautiful thing in the world to be up here with grandfather
the latter at that moment appeared coming from the goat shed and bringing two small foaming bowls of snowwhite milkone for clara and one for heidi
that will do the little daughter good he said nodding to clara it is from little swan and will make her strong
to your health child
drink it up
clara had never tasted goats milk before she hesitated and smelt it before putting it to her lips but seeing how heidi drank hers up without hesitating and how much she seemed to like it clara did the same and drank till there was not a drop left for she too found it delicious tasting just as if sugar and cinnamon had been mixed with it
tomorrow we will drink two said the grandfather who had looked on with satisfaction at seeing her follow heidis example
peter now arrived with the goats and while heidi was receiving her usual crowded morning greetings uncle drew peter aside to speak to him for the goats bleated so loudly and continuously in their wish to express their joy and affection that no one could be heard near them
attend to what i have to say he said
from today be sure you let little swan go where she likes
she has an instinct where to find the best food for herself and so if she wants to climb higher you follow her and it will do the others no harm if they go too on no account bring her back
a little more climbing wont hurt you and in this matter she probably knows better than you what is good for her i want her to give as fine milk as possible
why are you looking over there as if you wanted to eat somebody
nobody will interfere with you
so now be off and remember what i say
peter was accustomed to give immediate obedience to uncle and he marched off with his goats but with a turn of the head and roll of the eye that showed he had some thought in reserve
the goats carried heidi along with them a little way which was what peter wanted
you will have to come with them he called to her for i shall be obliged to follow little swan
i cannot heidi called back from the midst of her friends and i shall not be able to come for a long long timenot as long as clara is with me
grandfather however has promised to go up the mountain with both of us one day
heidi had now extricated herself from the goats and she ran back to clara
peter doubled his fists and made threatening gestures towards the invalid on her couch and then climbed up some distance without pause until he was out of sight for he was afraid uncle might have seen him and he did not care to know what uncle might have thought of the fists
clara and heidi had made so many plans for themselves that they hardly knew where to begin
heidi suggested that they should first write to grandmamma to whom they had promised to send word every day for grandmamma had not felt sure whether it would in the long run suit claras health to remain up the mountain or if she would continue to enjoy herself there
with daily news of her granddaughter she could stay on without anxiety at ragatz and be ready to go to clara at a moments notice
must we go indoors to write
asked clara who agreed to heidis proposal but did not want to move from where she was as it was so much nicer outside
heidi was prepared to arrange everything
she ran in and brought out her schoolbook and writing things and her own little stool
she put her reading book and copy book on claras knees to make a desk for her to write upon and she herself took her seat on the stool and sat to the bench and then they both began writing to grandmamma
but clara paused after every sentence to look about her it was too beautiful for much letter writing
the breeze had sunk a little and now only gently fanned her face and whispered lightly through the fir trees
little winged insects hummed and danced around her in the clear air and a great stillness lay over the far wide sunny pasture lands
lofty and silent rose the high mountain peaks above her and below lay the whole broad valley full of quiet peace
only now and again the call of some shepherdboy rang out through the air and echo answered softly from the rocks
the morning passed the children hardly knew how and now grandfather came with the midday bowls of steaming milk for the little daughter he said was to remain out as long as there was a gleam of sun in the sky
the midday meal was set out and eaten as yesterday in the open air
then heidi pushed claras chair under the fir trees for they had agreed to spend the afternoon under their shade and there tell each other all that had happened since heidi left frankfurt
if everything had gone on there as usual in a general way there were still all kinds of particular things to tell heidi about the various people who composed the sesemann household and who were all so well known to heidi
so they sat and chatted under the trees and the more lively grew their conversation the more loudly sang the birds overhead as if wishing to take part in the childrens gossip which evidently pleased them
so the hours flew by and all at once as it seemed the evening had come with the returning peter who still scowled and looked angry
goodnight peter called out heidi as she saw he had no intention of stopping to speak
goodnight peter called out clara in a friendly voice
peter took no notice and went surlily on with his goats
as clara saw the grandfather leading away little swan to milk her she was suddenly taken with a longing for another bowlful of the fragrant milk and waited impatiently for it
isnt it curious heidi she said astonished at herself as long as i can remember i have only eaten because i was obliged to and everything used to seem to taste of cod liver oil and i was always wishing there was no need to eat or drink and now i am longing for grandfather to bring me the milk
yes i know what it feels like replied heidi who remembered the many days in frankfurt when all her food used to seem to stick in her throat
clara however could not understand it the fact was that she had never in her life before spent a whole day in the open air much less in such high lifegiving mountain air
when grandfather at last brought her the evening milk she drank it up so quickly that she had emptied her bowl before heidi and then she asked for a little more
the grandfather went inside with both the childrens bowls and when he brought them out again full he had something else to add to their supper
he had walked over that afternoon to a herdsmans house where the sweetlytasting butter was made and had brought home a large pat some of which he had now spread thickly on two good slices of bread
he stood and watched with pleasure while clara and heidi ate their appetising meal with childish hunger and enjoyment
that night when clara lay down in her bed and prepared to watch the stars her eyes would not keep open and she fell asleep as soon as heidi and slept soundly all nighta thing she never remembered having done before
the following day and the day after passed in the same pleasant fashion and the third day there came a surprise for the children
two stout porters came up the mountain each carrying a bed on his shoulders with bedding of all kinds and two beautiful new white coverlids
the men also had a letter with them from grandmamma in which she said that these were for clara and heidi and that heidi in future was always to sleep in a proper bed and when she went down to dorfli in the winter she was to take one with her and leave the other at the hut so that clara might always know there was a bed ready for her when she paid a visit to the mountain
she went on to thank the children for their long letters and encouraged them to continue writing daily so that she might be able to picture all they were doing
so the grandfather went up and threw back the hay from heidis bed on to the great heap and then with his help the beds were transported to the loft
he put them close to one another so that the children might still be able to see out of the window for he knew what pleasure they had in the light from the sun and stars
meanwhile grandmamma down at ragatz was rejoicing at the excellent news of the invalid which reached her daily from the mountain
clara found the life more charming each day and could not say enough of the kindness and care which the grandfather lavished upon her nor of heidis lively and amusing companionship for the latter was more entertaining even than when in frankfurt with her and claras first thought when she woke each morning was oh how glad i am to be here still
having such fresh assurances each day that all was going well with clara grandmamma thought she might put off her visit to the children a little longer for the steep ride up and down was somewhat of a fatigue to her
the grandfather seemed to feel an especial sympathy for this little invalid charge for he tried to think of something fresh every day to help forward her recovery
he climbed up the mountain every afternoon higher and higher each day and came home in the evening with a large bunch of leaves which scented the air with a mingled fragrance as of carnations and thyme even from afar
he hung it up in the goat shed and the goats on their return were wild to get at it for they recognised the smell
but uncle did not go climbing after rare plants to give the goats the pleasure of eating them without any trouble of finding them what he gathered was for little swan alone that she might give extra fine milk and the effect of the extra feeding was shown in the way she flung her head in the air with everincreasing frolicsomeness and in the bright glow of her eye
clara had now been on the mountain for three weeks
for some days past the grandfather each morning after carrying her down had said wont the little daughter try if she can stand for a minute or two
and clara had made the effort in order to please him but had clung to him as soon as her feet touched the ground exclaiming that it hurt her so
he let her try a little longer however each day
it was many years since they had had such a splendid summer among the mountains
day after day there were the same cloudless sky and brilliant sun the flowers opened wide their fragrant blossoms and everywhere the eye was greeted with a glow of color and when the evening came the crimson light fell on mountain peaks and on the great snowfield till at last the sun sank in a sea of golden flame
and heidi never tired of telling clara of all this for only higher up could the full glory of the colors be rightly seen and more particularly did she dwell on the beauty of the spot on the higher slope of the mountain where the bright golden rock roses grew in masses and the blue flowers were in such numbers that the very grass seemed to have turned blue while near these were whole bushes of the brown blossoms with their delicious scent so that you never wanted to move again when you once sat down among them
she had just been expatiating on the flowers as she sat with clara under the fir trees one evening and had been telling her again of the wonderful light from the evening sun when such an irrepressible longing came over her to see it all once more that she jumped up and ran to her grandfather who was in the shed calling out almost before she was inside grandfather will you take us out with the goats tomorrow
oh it is so lovely up there now
very well he answered but if i do the little daughter must do something to please me she must try her best again this evening to stand on her feet
heidi ran back with the good news to clara and the latter promised to try her very best as the grandfather wished for she looked forward immensely to the next days excursion
heidi was so pleased and excited that she called out to peter as soon as she caught sight of him that evening peter peter we are all coming out with you tomorrow and are going to stay up there the whole day
peter cross as a bear grumbled some reply and lifted his stick to give greenfinch a blow for no reason in particular but greenfinch saw the movement and with a leap over snowflakes back she got out of the way and the stick only hit the air
clara and heidi got into their two fine beds that night full of delightful anticipation of the morrow they were so full of their plans that they agreed to keep awake all night and talk over them until they might venture to get up
but their heads had no sooner touched their soft pillows than the conversation suddenly ceased and clara fell into a dream of an immense field which looked the color of the sky so thickly inlaid was it with blue bellshaped flowers and heidi heard the great bird of prey calling to her from the heights above come
come
uncle went out early the next morning to see what kind of a day it was going to be
there was a reddish gold light over the higher peaks a light breeze springing up and the branches of the fir trees moved gently to and fro the sun was on its way
the old man stood and watched the green slopes under the higher peaks gradually growing brighter with the coming day and the dark shadows lifting from the valley until at first a rosy light filled its hollows and then the morning gold flooded every height and depththe sun had risen
uncle wheeled the chair out of the shed ready for the coming journey and then went in to call the children and tell them what a lovely sunrise it was
peter came up at this moment
the goats did not gather round him so trustfully as usual but seemed to avoid him timidly for peter had reached a high pitch of anger and bitterness and was laying about him with his stick very unnecessarily and where it fell the blow was no light one
for weeks now he had not had heidi all to himself as formerly
when he came up in the morning the invalid child was always already in her chair and heidi fully occupied with her
and it was the same thing over again when he came down in the evening
she had not come out with the goats once this summer and now today she was only coming in company with her friend and the chair and would stick by the latters side the whole time
it was the thought of this which was making him particularly cross this morning
there stood the chair on its high wheels peter seemed to see something proud and disdainful about it and he glared at it as at an enemy that had done him harm and was likely to do him more still today
he glanced roundthere was no sound anywhere no one to see him
he sprang forward like a wild creature caught hold of it and gave it a violent and angry push in the direction of the slope
the chair rolled swiftly forward and in another minute had disappeared
peter now sped up the mountain as if on wings not pausing till he was well in shelter of a large blackberry bush for he had no wish to be seen by uncle
but he was anxious to see what had become of the chair and his bush was well placed for that
himself hidden he could watch what happened below and see what uncle did without being discovered himself
so he looked and there he saw his enemy running faster and faster down hill then it turned head over heels several times and finally after one great bound rolled over and over to its complete destruction
the pieces flew in every directionfeet arms and torn fragments of the padded seat and bolsterand peter experienced a feeling of such unbounded delight at the sight that he leapt in the air laughing aloud and stamping for joy then he took a run round jumping over bushes on the way only to return to the same spot and fall into fresh fits of laughter
he was beside himself with satisfaction for he could see only good results for himself in this disaster to his enemy
now heidis friend would be obliged to go away for she would have no means of going about and when heidi was alone again she would come out with him as in the old days and everything would go on in the proper way again
but peter did not consider or did not know that when we do a wrong thing trouble is sure to follow
heidi now came running out of the hut and round to the shed
grandfather was behind with clara in his arms
the shed stood wide open the two loose planks having been taken down and it was quite light inside
heidi looked into every corner and ran from one end to the other and then stood still wondering what could have happened to the chair
grandfather now came up
how is this have you wheeled the chair away heidi
i have been looking everywhere for it grandfather you said it was standing ready outside and she again searched each corner of the shed with her eyes
at that moment the wind which had risen suddenly blew open the shed door and sent it banging back against the wall
it must have been the wind grandfather exclaimed heidi and her eyes grew anxious at this sudden discovery
if it has blown the chair all the way down to dorfli we shall not get it back in time and shall not be able to go
if it has rolled as far as that it will never come back for it is in a hundred pieces by now said the grandfather going round the corner and looking down
but its a curious thing to have happened
he added as he thought over the matter for the chair would have had to turn a corner before starting down hill
oh i am sorry lamented clara for we shall not be able to go today or perhaps any other day
i shall have to go home i suppose if i have no chair
oh i am so sorry i am so sorry
but heidi looked towards her grandfather with her usual expression of confidence
grandfather you will be able to do something wont you so that it need not be as clara says and so that she is not obliged to go home
well for the present we will go up the mountain as we had arranged and then later on we will see what can be done he answered much to the childrens delight
he went indoors fetched out a pile of shawls and laying them on the sunniest spot he could find set clara down upon them
then he fetched the childrens morning milk and had out his two goats
why is peter not here yet
thought uncle to himself for peters whistle had not been sounded that morning
the grandfather now took clara up on one arm and the shawls on the other
now then we will start he said the goats can come with us
heidi was pleased at this and walked on after her grandfather with an arm over either of the goats necks and the animals were so overjoyed to have her again that they nearly squeezed her flat between them out of sheer affection
when they reached the spot where the goats usually pastured they were surprised to find them already feeding there climbing about the rocks and peter with them lying his full length on the ground
ill teach you another time to go by like that you lazy rascal
uncle called to him
peter recognising the voice jumped up like a shot
no one was up he answered
have you seen anything of the chair
asked the grandfather
of what chair
called peter back in answer in a morose tone of voice
uncle said no more
he spread the shawls on the sunny slope and setting clara upon them asked if she was comfortable
as comfortable as in my chair she said thanking him and this seems the most beautiful spot
o heidi it is lovely it is lovely
she cried looking round her with delight
the grandfather prepared to leave them
they would now be safe and happy together he said and when it was time for dinner heidi was to go and fetch the bag from the shady hollow where he had put it peter was to bring them as much milk as they wanted but heidi was to see that it was little swans milk
he would come and fetch them towards evening he must now be off to see after the chair and ascertain what had become of it
the sky was dark blue and not a single cloud was to be seen from one horizon to the other
the great snowfield overhead sparkled as if set with thousands and thousands of gold and silver stars
the two grey mountains peaks lifted their lofty heads against the sky and looked solemnly down upon the valley as of old the great bird was poised aloft in the clear blue air and the mountain wind came over the heights and blew refreshingly around the children as they sat on the sunlit slope
it was all indescribably enjoyable to clara and heidi
now and again a young goat came and lay down beside them snowflake came oftenest putting her little head down near heidi and only moving because another goat came and drove her away
clara had learned to know them all so well that she never mistook one for the other now for each had an expression and ways of its own
and the goats had also grown familiar with clara and would rub their heads against her shoulder which was always a sign of acquaintanceship and goodwill
some hours went by and heidi began to think that she might just go over to the spot where all the flowers grew to see if they were fully blown and looking as lovely as the year before
clara could not go until grandfather came back that evening when the flowers probably would be already closed
the longing to go became stronger and stronger till she felt she could not resist it
would you think me unkind clara she said rather hesitatingly if i left you for a few minutes
i should run there and back very quickly
i want so to see how the flowers are lookingbut wait for an idea had come into heidis head
she ran and picked a bunch or two of green leaves and then took hold of snowflake and led her up to clara
there now you will not be alone said heidi giving the goat a little push to show her she was to lie down near clara which the animal quite understood
heidi threw the leaves into claras lap and the latter told her friend to go at once to look at the flowers as she was quite happy to be left with the goat she liked this new experience
heidi ran off and clara began to hold out the leaves one by one to snowflake who snoozled up to her new friend in a confiding manner and slowly ate the leaves from her hand
it was easy to see that snowflake enjoyed this peaceful and sheltered way of feeding for when with the other goats she had much persecution to endure from the larger and stronger ones of the flock
and clara found a strange new pleasure in sitting all alone like this on the mountain side her only companion a little goat that looked to her for protection
she suddenly felt a great desire to be her own mistress and to be able to help others instead of herself being always dependent as she was now
many thoughts unknown to her before came crowding into her mind and a longing to go on living in the sunshine and to be doing something that would bring happiness to another as now she was helping to make the goat happy
an unaccustomed feeling of joy took possession of her as if everything she had ever known or felt became all at once more beautiful and she seemed to see all things in a new light and so strong was the sense of this new beauty and happiness that she threw her arms round the little goats neck and exclaimed o snowflake how delightful it is up here
if only i could stay on for ever with you beside me
heidi had meanwhile reached her field of flowers and as she caught sight of it she uttered a cry of joy
the whole ground in front of her was a mass of shimmering gold where the cistus flowers spread their yellow blossoms
above them waved whole bushes of the deep blue bellflowers while the fragrance that arose from the whole sunlit expanse was as if the rarest balsam had been flung over it
the scent however came from the small brown flowers the little round heads of which rose modestly here and there among the yellow blossoms
heidi stood and gazed and drew in the delicious air
suddenly she turned round and reached claras side out of breath with running and excitement
oh you must come she called out as soon as she came in sight it is more beautiful than you can imagine and perhaps this evening it may not be so lovely
i believe i could carry you dont you think i could
clara looked at her and shook her head
why heidi what can you be thinking of
you are smaller than i am
oh if only i could walk
heidi looked round as if in search of something some new idea had evidently come into her head
peter was sitting up above looking down on the two children
he had been sitting and staring before him in the same way for hours as if he could not make out what he saw
he had destroyed the chair so that the friend might not be able to move anywhere and that her visit might come to an end and then a little while after she had appeared right up here under his very nose with heidi beside her
he thought his eyes must deceive him and yet there she was and no mistake about it
heidi now looked up to where he was sitting and called out in a peremptory voice peter come down here
i dont wish to come he called in reply
but you are to you must i cannot do it alone and you must come here and help me make haste and come down she called again in an urgent voice
i shall do nothing of the kind was the answer
heidi ran some way up the slope towards him and then pausing called again her eyes ablaze with anger if you dont come at once peter i will do something to you that you wont like i mean what i say
peter felt an inward throe at these words and a great fear seized him
he had done something wicked which he wanted no one to know about and so far he had thought himself safe
but now heidi spoke exactly as if she knew everything and whatever she did know she would tell her grandfather and there was no one he feared so much as this latter person
supposing he were to suspect what had happened about the chair
peters anguish of mind grew more acute
he stood up and went down to where heidi was awaiting him
i am coming and you wont do what you said
peter appeared now so submissive with fear that heidi felt quite sorry for him and answered assuringly no no of course not come along with me there is nothing to be afraid of in what i want you to do
as soon as they got to clara heidi gave her orders peter was to take hold of her under the arms on one side and she on the other and together they were to lift her up
this first movement was successfully carried through but then came the difficulty
as clara could not even stand how were they to support her and get her along
heidi was too small for her arm to serve clara to lean upon
you must put one arm well around my neck so and put the other through peters and lean firmly upon it then we shall be able to carry you
peter however had never given his arm to any one in his life
clara put hers in his but he kept his own hanging down straight beside him like a stick
thats not the way peter said heidi in an authoritative voice
you must put your arm out in the shape of a ring and clara must put hers through it and lean her weight upon you and whatever you do dont let your arm give way like that
i am sure we shall be able to manage
peter did as he was told but still they did not get on very well
clara was not such a light weight and the team did not match very well in size it was up one side and down the other so that the supports were rather wobbly
clara tried to use her own feet a little but each time drew them quickly back
put your foot down firmly once suggested heidi i am sure it will hurt you less after that
said clara hesitatingly but she followed heidis advice and ventured one firm step on the ground and then another she called out a little as she did it then she lifted her foot again and went on oh that was less painful already she exclaimed joyfully
try again said heidi encouragingly
and clara went on putting one foot out after another until all at once she called out i can do it heidi
i can make proper steps
and heidi cried out with even greater delight can you really make steps can you really walk
really walk by yourself
oh if only grandfather were here
and she continued gleefully to exclaim you can walk now clara you can walk
clara still held on firmly to her supports but with every step she felt safer on her feet as all three became aware and heidi was beside herself with joy
now we shall be able to come up here together every day and go just where we like and you will be able all your life to walk about as i do and not have to be pushed in a chair and you will get quite strong and well
it is the greatest happiness we could have had
and clara heartily agreed for she could think of no greater joy in the world than to be strong and able to go about like other people and no longer to have to lie from day to day in her invalid chair
they had not far to go to reach the field of flowers and could already catch sight of the cistus flowers glowing gold in the sun
as they came to the bushes of the blue bell flowers with sunny inviting patches of warm ground between them clara said mightnt we sit down here for a while
this was just what heidi enjoyed and so the children sat down in the midst of the flowers clara for the first time on the dry warm mountain grass and she found it indescribably delightful
around her were the blue flowers softly waving to and fro and beyond the gleaming patches of the cistus flowers and the red centaury while the sweet scent of the brown blossoms and of the fragrant prunella enveloped her as she sat
everything was so lovely
so lovely
and heidi who was beside her thought she had never seen it so perfectly beautiful up here before and she did not know herself why she felt so glad at heart that she longed to shout for joy
then she suddenly remembered that clara was cured that was the crowning delight of all that made life so delightful in the midst of all this surrounding beauty
clara sat silent overcome with the enchantment of all that her eye rested upon and with the anticipation of all the happiness that was now before her
there seemed hardly room in her heart for all her joyful emotions and these and the ecstasy aroused by the sunlight and the scent of the flowers held her dumb
peter also lay among the flowers without moving or speaking for he was fast asleep
the breeze came blowing softly and caressingly from behind the sheltering rocks and passed whisperingly through the bushes overhead
heidi got up now and then to run about for the flowers waving in the warm wind seemed to smell sweeter and to grow more thickly whichever way she went and she felt she must sit down at each fresh spot to enjoy the sight and scent
so the hours went by
it was long past noon when a small troop of goats advanced solemnly towards the plain of flowers
it was not a feeding place of theirs for they did not care to graze on flowers
they looked like an embassy arriving with greenfinch as their leader
they had evidently come in search of their companions who had left them in the lurch and who had contrary to all custom remained away so long for the goats could tell the time without mistake
as soon as greenfinch caught sight of the three missing friends amid the flowers she set up an extra loud bleat whereupon all the others joined in a chorus of bleats and the whole company came trotting towards the children
peter woke up rubbing his eyes for he had been dreaming that he saw the chair again with its beautiful red padding standing whole and uninjured before the grandfathers door and indeed just as he awoke he thought he was looking at the brassheaded nails that studded it all round but it was only the bright yellow flowers beside him
he experienced again a dreadful fear of mind that he had lost in this dream of the uninjured chair
even though heidi had promised not to do anything there still remained the lively dread that his deed might be found out in some other way
he allowed heidi to do what she liked with him for he was reduced to such a state of low spirits and meekness that he was ready to give his help to clara without murmur or resistance
when all three had got back to their old quarters heidi ran and brought forward the bag and proceeded to fulfil her promise for her threat of the morning had been concerned with peters dinner
she had seen her grandfather putting in all sorts of good things and had been pleased to think of peter having a large share of them and she had meant him to understand when he refused at first to help her that he would get nothing for his dinner but peters conscience had put another interpretation upon her words
heidi took the food out of the bag and divided it into three portions and each was of such a goodly size that she thought to herself there will be plenty of ours left for him to have more still
she gave the other two their dinners and sat down with her own beside clara and they all three ate with a good appetite after their great exertions
it ended as heidi had expected and peter got as much food again as his own share with what clara and heidi had over from theirs after they had both eaten as much as they wanted
peter ate up every bit of food to the last crumb but there was something wanting to his usual enjoyment of a good dinner for every mouthful he swallowed seemed to choke him and he felt something gnawing inside him
they were so late at their dinner that they had not long to wait after they had finished before grandfather came up to fetch them
heidi rushed forward to meet him as soon as he appeared as she wanted to be the first to tell him the good news
she was so excited that she could hardly get her words out when she did get up to him but he soon understood and a look of extreme pleasure came into his face
he hastened up to where clara was sitting and said with a cheerful smile so weve made the effort have we and won the day
then he lifted her up and putting his left arm behind her and giving her his right to lean upon made her walk a little way which she did with less trembling and hesitation than before now that she had such a strong arm round her
heidi skipped along beside her in triumphant glee and the grandfather looked too as if some happiness had befallen him
but now he took clara up in his arms
we must not overdo it he said and it is high time we went home and he started off down the mountain path for he was anxious to get her indoors that she might rest after her unusual fatigue
when peter got to dorfli that evening he found a large group of people collected round a certain spot pushing one another and looking over each others shoulders in their eagerness to catch sight of something lying on the ground
peter thought he should like to see too and poked and elbowed till he made his way through
there it lay the thing he had wanted to see
scattered about the grass were the remains of claras chair part of the back and the middle bit and enough of the red padding and the bright nails to show how magnificent the chair had been when it was entire
i was here when the men passed carrying it up said the baker who was standing near peter
ill bet any one that it was worth twentyfive pounds at least
i cannot think how such an accident could have happened
uncle said the wind might perhaps have done it remarked one of the women who could not sufficiently admire the red upholstery
its a good job that no one but the wind did it said the baker again or he might smart for it
no doubt the gentleman in frankfurt when he hears what has happened will make all inquiries about it
i am glad for myself that i have not been seen up the mountain for a good two years as suspicion is likely to fall on any one who was about up there at the time
many more opinions were passed on the matter but peter had heard enough
he crept quietly away out of the crowd and then took to his heels and ran up home as fast as he could as if he thought some one was after him
the bakers words had filled him with fear and trembling
he was sure now that any day a constable might come over from frankfurt and inquire about the destruction of the chair and then everything would come out and he would be seized and carried off to frankfurt and there put in prison
the whole picture of what was coming was clear before him and his hair stood on end with terror
he reached home in this disturbed state of mind
he would not open his mouth in reply to anything that was said to him he would not eat his potatoes all he did was to creep off to bed as quickly as possible and hide under the bedclothes and groan
peter has been eating sorrel again and is evidently in pain by the way he is groaning said brigitta
you must give him a little more bread to take with him give him a bit of mine tomorrow said the grandmother sympathisingly
as the children lay that night in bed looking out at the stars heidi said i have been thinking all day what a happy thing it is that god does not give us what we ask for even when we pray and pray and pray if he knows there is something better for us have you felt like that
why do you ask me that tonight all of a sudden
because i prayed so hard when i was in frankfurt that i might go home at once and because i was not allowed to i thought god had forgotten me
and now you see if i had come away at first when i wanted to you would never have come here and would never have got well
clara had in her turn become thoughtful
but heidi she began again in that case we ought never to pray for anything as god always intends something better for us than we know or wish for
you must not think it is like that clara replied heidi eagerly
we must go on praying for everything for everything so that god may know we do not forget that it all comes from him
if we forget god then he lets us go our own way and we get into trouble grandmamma told me so
and if he does not give us what we ask for we must not think that he has not heard us and leave off praying but we must still pray and say i am sure dear god that thou art keeping something better for me and i will not be unhappy for i know that thou wilt make everything right in the end
how did you learn all that
grandmamma explained it to me first of all and then when it all happened just as she said i knew it myself and i think clara she went on as she sat up in bed we ought certainly to thank god tonight that you can walk now and that he has made us so happy
yes heidi i am sure you are right and i am glad you reminded me i almost forgot my prayers for very joy
both children said their prayers and each thanked god in her own way for the blessing he had bestowed on clara who had for so long lain weak and ill
the next morning the grandfather suggested that they should now write to the grandmamma and ask her if she would not come and pay them a visit as they had something new to show her
but the children had another plan in their heads for they wanted to prepare a great surprise for grandmamma
clara was first to have more practice in walking so that she might be able to go a little way by herself above all things grandmamma was not to have a hint of it
they asked the grandfather how long he thought this would take and when he told them about a week or less they immediately sat down and wrote a pressing invitation to grandmamma asking her to come soon but no word was said about there being anything new to see
the following days were some of the most joyous that clara had spent on the mountain
she awoke each morning with a happy voice within her crying i am well now
i am well now
i shant have to go about in a chair i can walk by myself like other people
then came the walking and every day she found it easier and was able to go a longer distance
the movement gave her such an appetite that the grandfather cut his bread and butter a little thicker each day and was well pleased to see it disappear
he now brought out with it a large jugful of the foaming milk and filled her little bowl over and over again
and so another week went by and the day came which was to bring grandmamma up the mountain for her second visit
grandmamma wrote the day before her arrival to let the children know that they might expect her without fail
peter brought up the letter early the following morning
grandfather and the children were already outside and the goats were awaiting him shaking their heads frolicsomely in the fresh morning air while the children stroked them and wished them a pleasant journey up the mountain
uncle stood near looking now at the fresh faces of the children now at his wellkept goats with a smile on his face evidently well pleased with the sight of both
as peter neared the group his steps slackened and the instant he had handed the letter to uncle he turned quickly away as if frightened and as he went he gave a hasty glance behind him as if the thing he feared was pursuing him and then he gave a leap and ran off up the mountain
grandfather said heidi who had been watching him with astonished eyes why does peter always behave now like the great turk when he thinks somebody is after him with a stick he turns and shakes his head and goes off with a bound just like that
perhaps peter fancies he sees the stick which he so well deserves coming after him answered grandfather
peter ran up the first slope without a pause when he was well out of sight however he stood still and looked suspiciously about him
suddenly he gave a jump and looked behind him with a terrified expression as if some one had caught hold of him by the nape of the neck for peter expected every minute that the policeconstable from frankfurt would leap out upon him from behind some bush or hedge
the longer his suspense lasted the more frightened and miserable he became he did not know a moments peace
heidi now set about tidying the hut as grandmamma must find everything clean and in good order when she arrived
clara looked on amused and interested to watch the busy heidi at her work
so the morning soon went by and grandmamma might now be expected at any minute
the children dressed themselves and went and sat together outside on the seat ready to receive her
grandfather joined them that they might see the splendid bunch of blue gentians which he had been up the mountain to gather and the children exclaimed with delight at the beauty of the flowers as they shone in the morning sun
the grandfather then carried them indoors
heidi jumped up from time to time to see if there was any sign of grandmammas approach
at last she saw the procession winding up the mountain just in the order she had expected
first there was the guide then the white horse with grandmamma mounted upon it and last of all the porter with a heavy bundle on his back for grandmamma would not think of going up the mountain without a full supply of wraps and rugs
nearer and nearer wound the procession at last it reached the top and grandmamma was there looking down on the children from her horse
she no sooner saw them however sitting side by side than she began quickly dismounting as she cried out in a shocked tone of voice why is this
why are you not lying in your chair clara
what are you all thinking about
but even before she had got close to them she threw up her hands in astonishment exclaiming further is it really you dear child
why your cheeks have grown quite round and rosy
i should hardly have known you again
and she was hastening forward to embrace her when heidi slipped down from the seat and clara leaning on her shoulder the two children began walking along quite coolly and naturally
then indeed grandmamma was surprised or rather alarmed for she thought at first that it must be some unheard of proceeding of heidis devising
but noclara was actually walking steadily and uprightly beside heidiand now the two children turned and came towards her with beaming faces and rosy cheeks
laughing and crying she ran to them and embraced first clara and then heidi and then clara again unable to speak for joy
all at once she caught sight of uncle standing by the seat and looking on smiling at the meeting
she took claras arm in hers and with continual expressions of delight at the fact that the child could now really walk about with her she went up to the old man and then letting go claras arm she seized his hands
my dear uncle
how much we have to thank you for
it is all your doing
it is your caring and nursing and gods good sun and mountain air he interrupted her smiling
yes and dont forget the beautiful milk i have put in clara
grandmamma you cant think what a quantity of goats milk i drink and how nice it is
i can see that by your cheeks child answered grandmamma
i really should not have known you you have grown quite strong and plump and taller too i never hoped or expected to see you look like that
i cannot take my eyes off you for i can hardly yet believe it
but now i must telegraph without delay to my son in paris and tell him he must come here at once
i shall not say why it will be the greatest happiness he has ever known
my dear uncle how can i send a telegram have you dismissed the men yet
they have gone he answered but if you are in a hurry i will fetch peter and he can take it for you
grandmamma thanked him for she was anxious that the good news should not be kept from her son a day longer than was possible
so uncle went aside a little way and blew such a resounding whistle through his fingers that he awoke a responsive echo among the rocks far overhead
he had not to wait many minutes before peter came running down in answer for he knew the sound of uncles whistle
peter arrived looking as white as a ghost for he quite thought uncle was sending for him to give him up
but as it was he only had a written paper given him with instructions to take it down at once to the postoffice at dorfli uncle would settle for the payment later as it was not safe to give peter too much to look after
peter went off with the paper in his hand feeling some relief of mind for the present for as uncle had not whistled for him in order to give him up it was evident that no policeman had yet arrived
so now they could all sit down in peace to their dinner round the table in front of the hut and grandmamma was given a detailed account of all that had taken place
how grandfather had made clara try first to stand and then to move her feet a little every day and how they had settled for the days excursion up the mountain and the chair had been blown away
how claras desire to see the flowers had induced her to take the first walk and so by degrees one thing had led to another
the recital took some time for grandmamma continually interrupted it with fresh exclamations of surprise and thankfulness it hardly seems possible
i can scarcely believe it is not all a dream
are we really awake and are all sitting here by the mountain hut and is that roundfaced healthylooking child my poor little white sickly clara
and clara and heidi could not get over their delight at the success of the surprise they had so carefully arranged for grandmamma and at the latters continued astonishment
meanwhile herr sesemann who had finished his business in paris had also been preparing a surprise
without saying a word to his mother he got into the train one sunny morning and travelled that day to basle the next morning he continued his journey for a great longing had seized him to see his little daughter from whom he had been separated the whole summer
he arrived at ragatz a few hours after his mother had left
when he heard that she had that very day started for the mountain he immediately hired a carriage and drove off to mayenfeld here he found that he could if he liked drive on as far as dorfli which he did as he thought the walk up from that place would be as long as he cared for
herr sesemann found he was right for the climb up the mountain as it was proved long and fatiguing to him
he went on and on but still no hut came in sight and yet he knew there was one where peter lived half way up for the path had been described to him over and over again
there were traces of climbers to be seen on all sides the narrow footpaths seemed to run in every direction and herr sesemann began to wonder if he was on the right one and whether the hut lay perhaps on the other side of the mountain
he looked round to see if any one was in sight of whom he could ask the way but far and wide there was not a soul to be seen or a sound to be heard
only at moments the mountain wind whistled through the air and the insects hummed in the sunshine or a happy bird sang out from the branches of a solitary larch tree
herr sesemann stood still for a while to let the cool alpine wind blow on his hot face
but now some one came running down the mountain sideit was peter with the telegram in his hand
he ran straight down the steep slope not following the path on which herr sesemann was standing
as soon as the latter caught sight of him he beckoned to him to come
peter advanced towards him slowly and timidly with a sort of sidelong movement as if he could only move one leg properly and had to drag the other after him
hurry up lad called herr sesemann and when peter was near enough tell me he said is this the way to the hut where the old man and the child heidi live and where the visitors from frankfurt are staying
a low sound of fear was the only answer he received as peter turned to run away in such precipitous haste that he fell head over heels several times and went rolling and bumping down the slope in involuntary bounds just in the same way as the chair only that peter fortunately did not fall to pieces as that had done
only the telegram came to grief and that was torn into fragments and flew away
how extraordinarily timid these mountain dwellers are
thought herr sesemann to himself for he quite believed that it was the sight of a stranger that had made such an impression on this unsophisticated child of the mountains
after watching peters violent descent towards the valley for a few minutes he continued his journey
peter meanwhile with all his efforts could not stop himself but went rolling on and still tumbling head over heels at intervals in a most remarkable manner
but this was not the most terrible part of his sufferings at the moment for far worse was the fear and horror that possessed him feeling sure as he did now that the policeman had really come over for him from frankfurt
he had no doubt at all that the stranger who had asked him the way was the very man himself
just as he had rolled to the edge of that last high slope above dorfli he was caught in a bush and at last able to keep himself from falling any farther
he lay still for a second or two to recover himself and to think over matters
well done
another of you come bumping along like this
said a voice close to peter and which of you tomorrow is the wind going to send rolling down like a badlysewn sack of potatoes
it was the baker who stood there laughing
he had been strolling out to refresh himself after his hot days work and had watched with amusement as he saw peter come rolling over and over in much the same way as the chair
peter was on his feet in a moment
he had received a fresh shock
without once looking behind him he began hurrying up the slope again
he would have liked best to go home and creep into bed so as to hide himself for he felt safest when there
but he had left the goats up above and uncle had given him strict injunctions to make haste back so that they might not be left too long alone
and he stood more in awe of uncle than any one and would not have dared to disobey him on any account
there was no help for it he had to go back and peter went on groaning and limping
he could run no more for the anguish of mind he had been through and the bumping and shaking he had received were beginning to tell upon him
and so with lagging steps and groans he slowly made his way up the mountain
shortly after meeting peter herr sesemann passed the first hut and so was satisfied that he was on the right path
he continued his climb with renewed courage and at last after a long and exhausting walk he came in sight of his goal
there only a little distance farther up stood the grandfathers home with the dark tops of the fir trees waving above its roof
herr sesemann was delighted to have come to the last steep bit of his journey in another minute or two he would be with his little daughter and he pleased himself with the thought of her surprise
but the company above had seen his approaching figure and recognized who it was and they were preparing something he little expected as a surprise on their part
as he stepped on to the space in front of the hut two figures came towards him
one a tall girl with fair hair and pink cheeks leaning on heidi whose dark eyes were dancing with joy
herr sesemann suddenly stopped staring at the two children and all at once the tears started to his eyes
what memories arose in his heart
just so had claras mother looked the fairhaired girl with the delicate pinkandwhite complexion
herr sesemann did not know if he was awake or dreaming
dont you know me papa
called clara to him her face beaming with happiness
am i so altered since you saw me
then herr sesemann ran to his child and clasped her in his arms
yes you are indeed altered
how is it possible
is it true what i see
and the delighted father stepped back to look full at her again and to make sure that the picture would not vanish before his eyes
are you my little clara really my little clara
he kept on saying then he clasped her in his arms again and again put her away from him that he might look and make sure it was she who stood before him
and now grandmamma came up anxious for a sight of her sons happy face
well what do you say now dear son
you have given us a pleasant surprise but it is nothing in comparison to what we have prepared for you you must confess and she gave her son an affectionate kiss as she spoke
but now she went on you must come and pay your respects to uncle who is our chief benefactor
yes indeed and with the little inmate of our own house our little heidi too said herr sesemann shaking heidi by the hand
are you still well and happy in your mountain home
but i need not ask no alpine rose could look more blooming
i am glad child it is a pleasure to me to see you so
and heidi looked up with equal pleasure into herr sesemanns kind face
how good he had always been to her
and that he should find such happiness awaiting him up here on the mountain made her heart beat with gladness
grandmamma now led her son to introduce him to uncle and while the two men were shaking hands and herr sesemann was expressing his heartfelt thanks and boundless astonishment to the old man grandmamma wandered round to the back to see the old fir trees again
here another unexpected sight met her gaze for there under the trees where the long branches had left a clear space on the ground stood a great bush of the most wonderful dark blue gentians as fresh and shining as if they were growing on the spot
she clasped her hands enraptured with their beauty
how exquisite
what a lovely sight
heidi dearest child come here
is it you who have prepared this pleasure for me
it is perfectly wonderful
the children ran up
no no i did not put them there said heidi but i know who did
they grow just like that on the mountain grandmamma only if anything they look more beautiful still clara put in but guess who brought those down today and as she spoke she gave such a pleased smile that the grandmother thought for a moment the child herself must have gathered them
but that was hardly possible
at this moment a slight rustling was heard behind the fir trees
it was peter who had just arrived
he had made a long round having seen from the distance who it was standing beside uncle in front of the hut and he was trying to slip by unobserved
but grandmamma had seen and recognized him and suddenly the thought struck her that it might be peter who had brought the flowers and that he was now trying to get away unseen feeling shy about it but she could not let him go off like that he must have some little reward
come along boy come here do not be afraid she called to him
peter stood still petrified with fear
after all he had gone through that day he felt he had no longer any power of resistance left
all he could think was its all up with me now
every hair of his head stood on end and he stepped forth from behind the fir trees his face pale and distorted with terror
courage boy said grandmamma in her effort to dispel his shyness tell me now straight out without hesitation was it you who did it
peter did not lift his eyes and therefore did not see at what grandmamma was pointing
but he knew that uncle was standing at the corner of the hut fixing him with his grey eyes while beside him stood the most terrible person that peter could conceivethe policeconstable from frankfurt
quaking in every limb and with trembling lips he muttered a low yes
well and what is there dreadful about that
said grandmamma
becausebecauseit is all broken to pieces and no one can put it together again
peter brought out his words with difficulty and his knees knocked together so that he could hardly stand
grandmamma went up to uncle
is that poor boy a little out of his mind
she asked sympathisingly
not in the least uncle assured her it is only that he was the wind that sent the chair rolling down the slope and he is expecting his welldeserved punishment
grandmamma found this hard to believe for in her opinion peter did not look an entirely bad boy nor could he have any reason for destroying such a necessary thing as the chair
but uncle had only given expression to the suspicion that he had from the moment the accident happened
the angry looks which peter had from the beginning cast at clara and the other signs of his dislike to what had been taking place on the mountain had not escaped uncles eye
putting two and two together he had come to the right conclusion as to the cause of the disaster and he therefore spoke without hesitation when he accused peter
the lady broke into lively expostulations on hearing this
no no dear uncle we will not punish the poor boy any further
one must be fair to him
here are all these strangers from frankfurt who come and carry away heidi his one sole possession and a possession well worth having too and he is left to sit alone day after day for weeks with nothing to do but brood over his wrongs
no no let us be fair to him his anger got the upper hand and drove him an act of revengea foolish one i own but then we all behave foolishly when we are angry
and saying this she went back to peter who still stood frightened and trembling
she sat down on the seat under the fir trees and called him to her kindly come here boy and stand in front of me for i have something to say to you
leave off shaking and trembling for i want you to listen to me
you sent the chair rolling down the mountain so that it was broken to pieces
that was a very wrong thing to do as you yourself knew very well at the time and you also knew that you deserved to be punished for it and in order to escape this you have been doing all you can to hide the truth from everybody
but be sure of this peter that those who do wrong make a mistake when they think no one knows anything about it
for god sees and hears everything and when the wicked doer tries to hide what he has done then god wakes up a little watchman that he places inside us all when we are born and who sleeps on quietly till we do something wrong
and the little watchman has a small goad in his hand and when he wakes up he keeps on pricking us with it so that we have not a moments peace
and the watchman torments us still further for he keeps on calling out now you will be found out
now they will drag you off to punishment
and so we pass our life in fear and trouble and never know a moments happiness or peace
have you not felt something like that lately peter
peter gave a contrite nod of the head as one who knew all about it for grandmamma had described his own feelings exactly
and you calculated wrongly also in another way continued grandmamma for you see the harm you intended has turned out for the best for those you wished to hurt
as clara had no chair to go in and yet wanted so much to see the flowers she made the effort to walk and every day since she has been walking better and better and if she remains up here she will in time be able to go up the mountain every day much oftener than she would have done in her chair
so you see peter god is able to bring good out of evil for those whom you meant to injure and you who did the evil were left to suffer the unhappy consequences of it
do you thoroughly understand all i have said to you peter
if so do not forget my words and whenever you feel inclined to do anything wrong think of the little watchman inside you with his goad and his disagreeable voice
will you remember all this
yes i will answered peter still very subdued for he did not yet know how the matter was going to end as the police constable was still standing with the uncle
thats right and now the thing is over and done for said grandmamma
but i should like you to have something for a pleasant reminder of the visitors from frankfurt
can you tell me anything that you have wished very much to have
what would you like best as a present
peter lifted his head at this and stared openeyed at grandmamma
up to the last minute he had been expecting something dreadful to happen and now he might have anything that he wanted
his mind seemed all of a whirl
i mean what i say went on grandmamma
you shall choose what you would like to have as a remembrance from the frankfurt visitors and as a token that they will not think any more of the wrong thing you did
now do you understand me boy
the fact began at last to dawn upon peters mind that he had no further punishment to fear and that the kind lady sitting in front of him had delivered him from the police constable
he suddenly felt as if the weight of a mountain had fallen off him
he had also by this time awakened to the further conviction that it was better to make a full confession at once of anything he had done wrong or had left undone and so he said and i lost the paper too
grandmamma had to consider a moment what he meant but soon recalled his connection with her telegram and answered kindly you are a good boy to tell me
never conceal anything you have done wrong and then all will come right again
and now what would you like me to give you
peter grew almost giddy with the thought that he could have anything in the world that he wished for
he had a vision of the yearly fair at mayenfeld with the glittering stalls and all the lovely things that he had stood gazing at for hours without a hope of ever possessing one of them for peters purse never held more than a halfpenny and all these fascinating objects cost double that amount
there were the pretty little red whistles that he could use to call his goats and the splendid knives with rounded handles known as toadstrikers with which one could do such famous work among the hazel bushes
peter remained pondering he was trying to think which of these two desirable objects he should best like to have and he found it difficult to decide
then a bright thought occurred to him he would then be able to think over the matter between now and next years fair
a penny answered peter who was no longer in doubt
grandmamma could not help laughing
that is not an extravagant request
come here then
and she pulled out her purse and put four bright round shillings in his hand and then laid some pennies on top of it
we will settle our accounts at once she continued and i will explain them to you
i have given you as many pennies as there are weeks in the year and so every sunday throughout the year you can take out a penny to spend
as long as i live
said peter quite innocently
grandmamma laughed more still at this and the men hearing her paused in their talk to listen to what was going on
yes boy you shall have it all your lifei will put it down in my will
do you hear my son
and you are to put it down in yours as well a penny a week to peter as long as he lives
herr sesemann nodded his assent and joined in the laughter
peter looked again at the present in his hand to make sure he was not dreaming and then said thank god
and he went off running and leaping with more even than his usual agility and this time managed to keep his feet for it was not fear but joy such as he had never known before in his life that now sent him flying up the mountain
all trouble and trembling had disappeared and he was to have a penny every week for life
as later after dinner the party were sitting together chatting clara drew her father a little aside and said with an eagerness that had been unknown to the little tired invalid o papa if you only knew all that grandfather has done for me from day to day
i cannot reckon his kindnesses but i shall never forget them as long as i live
and i keep on thinking what i could do for him or what present i could make him that would give him half as much pleasure as he has given me
that is just what i wish most myself clara replied her father whose face grew happier each time he looked at his little daughter
i have been also thinking how we can best show our gratitude to our good benefactor
herr sesemann now went over to where uncle and grandmamma were engaged in lively conversation
uncle stood up as he approached and herr sesemann taking him by the hand said dear friend let us exchange a few words with one another
you will believe me when i tell you that i have known no real happiness for years past
what worth to me were money and property when they were unable to make my poor child well and happy
with the help of god you have made her whole and strong and you have given new life not only to her but to me
tell me now in what way can i show my gratitude to you
i can never repay all you have done but whatever is in my power to do is at your service
speak friend and tell me what i can do
uncle had listened to him quietly with a smile of pleasure on his face as he looked at the happy father
herr sesemann he replied in his dignified way believe me that i too have my share in the joy of your daughters recovery and my trouble is well repaid by it
i thank you heartily for all you have said but i have need of nothing i have enough for myself and the child as long as i live
one wish alone i have and if that could be satisfied i should have no further care in life
speak dear friend and tell me what it is said herr sesemann entreatingly
i am growing old uncle went on and shall not be here much longer
i have nothing to leave the child when i die and she has no relations except one person who will always like to make what profit out of her she can
if you could promise me that heidi shall never have to go and earn her living among strangers then you would richly reward me for all i have done for your child
there could never be any question of such a thing as that my dear friend said herr sesemann quickly
i look upon the child as our own
ask my mother my daughter you may be sure that they will never allow the child to be left in any one elses care
but if it will make you happier i give you here my hand upon it
i promise you heidi shall never have to go and earn her living among strangers i will make provision against this both during my life and after
but now i have something else to say
independent of her circumstances the child is totally unfitted to live a life away from home we found out that when she was with us
but she has made friends and among them i know one who is at this moment in frankfurt he is winding up his affairs there that he may be free to go where he likes and take his rest
i am speaking of my friend the doctor who came over here in the autumn and who having well considered your advice intends to settle in this neighborhood for he has never felt so well and happy anywhere as in the company of you and heidi
so you see the child will henceforth have two protectors near her and may they both live long to share the task
god grant it indeed may be so
added grandmamma shaking uncles hand warmly as she spoke to show how sincerely she echoed her sons wish
then putting her arm round heidi who was standing near she drew the child to her
and i have a question to ask you too dear heidi
tell me if there is anything you particularly wish for
yes there is answered heidi promptly looking up delightedly at grandmamma
then tell me at once dear what it is
i want to have the bed i slept in at frankfurt with the high pillows and the thick coverlid and then grandmother will not have to lie with her head down hill and hardly able to breathe and she will be warm enough under the coverlid not to have to wear her shawl in bed to prevent her freezing to death
in her eagerness to obtain what she had set her heart upon heidi hardly gave herself time to get out all she had to say and did not pause for breath till she reached the end of her sentence
dearest child answered grandmamma moved by heidis speech what is this you tell me of grandmother
you are right to remind me
in the midst of our own happiness we forget too often that which we ought to remember before all things
when god has shown us some special mercy we should think at once of those who are denied so many things
i will telegraph to frankfurt at once
fraulein rottenmeier shall pack up the bed this very day and it will be here in two days time
god willing grandmother shall soon be sleeping comfortably upon it
heidi skipped round grandmamma in her glee and then stopping all of a sudden said quickly i must make haste down and tell grandmother and she will be in trouble too at my not having been to see her for such a long time
for she felt she could not wait another moment before carrying the good news down to grandmother and moreover the recollection came to her of the distress the old woman was in when she last saw her
no no heidi what can you be thinking of said her grandfather reprovingly
you cant be running backwards and forwards like that when you have visitors
but grandmamma interfered on heidis behalf
the child is not so far wrong uncle she said and poor grandmother has too long been deprived of heidi for our sakes
let us all go down to her together
i believe my horse is waiting for me and i can ride down from there and as soon as i get to dorfli the message shall be sent off
what do you think of my plan son
herr sesemann had not yet had time to speak of his travelling plans so he begged his mother to wait a few moments that he might tell her what he proposed doing
herr sesemann had been arranging that he and his mother should make a little tour in switzerland first ascertaining if clara was in a fit state to go some part of the way with them
but now he would have the full enjoyment of his daughters company and that being so he did not want to miss any of these beautiful days of later summer but to start at once on the journey that he now looked forward to with such additional pleasure
and so he proposed that they should spend the night in dorfli and that next day he should come and fetch clara then they would all three go down to ragatz and make that their starting point
clara was rather upset at first at the thought of saying good bye like this to the mountain she could not help being pleased however at the prospect of the journey and no time was allowed her to give way to lamentation
grandmamma had already taken heidi by the hand preparatory to leading the way when she suddenly turned
but what is to become of clara
she asked remembering all at once that the child could not yet take so long a walk
she gave a nod of satisfaction as she saw that uncle had already taken clara up in his arms and was following her with sturdy strides
herr sesemann brought up the rear and so they all started down the mountain
heidi kept jumping for joy as she and grandmamma walked along side by side and grandmamma asked all about grandmother how she lived and what she did especially in the winter when it was so cold
and heidi gave her a minute account of everything for she knew all that went on at grandmothers and told her how grandmother sat crouching in her corner and trembling with cold
she was able to give her exact particulars of what grandmother had and had not to eat
grandmamma listened with interest and sympathy until they came to grandmothers
brigitta was just hanging out peters second shirt in the sun so that he might have it ready to put on when he had worn the other long enough
as soon as she saw the company approaching she rushed indoors
the whole party of them are just going past mother evidently all returning home again she informed the old woman
uncle is with them carrying the sick child
alas is it really to be so then
sighed the grandmother
and you saw heidi with them
then they are taking her away
if only she could come and put her hand in mine again
if i could but hear her voice once more
at this moment the door flew open and heidi sprang across to the corner and threw her arms round grandmother
grandmother
my bed is to be sent from frankfurt with all the three pillows and the thick coverlid grandmamma says it will be here in two days
heidi could not get out her words quickly enough for she was impatient to see grandmothers great joy at the news
the latter smiled but said a little sadly she must indeed be a good kind lady and i ought to be glad to think she is taking you with her but i shall not outlive it long
what is this i hear
who has been telling my good grandmother such tales
exclaimed a kindly voice and grandmother felt her hand taken and warmly pressed for grandmamma had followed heidi in and heard all that was said
no no there is no thought of such a thing
heidi is going to stay with you and make you happy
we want to see her again but we shall come to her
we hope to pay a visit to the alm every year for we have good cause to offer up especial thanks to god upon this spot where so great a miracle has been wrought upon our child
and now grandmothers face was lighted up with genuine happiness and she pressed frau sesemanns hand over and over again unable to speak her thanks while two large tears of joy rolled down her aged cheeks
and heidi saw the glad change come over grandmothers face and she too now was entirely happy
she clung to the old woman saying hasnt it all come about grandmother just like the hymn i read to you last time
isnt the bed from frankfurt sent to make you well
yes heidi and many many other good things too which god has sent me said the grandmother deeply moved
i did not think it possible that there were so many kind people ready to trouble themselves about a poor old woman and to do so much for her
nothing strengthens our belief in a kind heavenly father who never forgets even the least of his creatures so much as to know that there are such people full of goodness and pity for a poor useless creature such as i am
my good grandmother said frau sesemann interrupting her we are all equally poor and helpless in the eyes of god and all have equal need that he should not forget us
but now we must say goodbye but only till we meet again for when we pay our next years visit to the alm you will be the first person we shall come and see meanwhile we shall not forget you
and frau sesemann took grandmothers hand again and shook it in farewell
but grandmother would not let her off even then without more words of gratitude and without calling down on her benefactress and all belonging to her every blessing that god had to bestow
at last herr sesemann and his mother were able to continue their journey downwards while uncle carried clara back home with heidi beside him so full of joy of what was coming for grandmother that every step was a jump
but there were many tears shed the following morning by the departing clara who wept to say goodbye to the beautiful mountain home where she had been happier than ever in her life before
heidi did her best to comfort her
summer will be here again in no time she said and then you will come again and it will be nicer still for you will be able to walk about from the beginning
we can then go out every day with the goats up to where the flowers grow and enjoy ourselves from the moment you arrive
herr sesemann had come as arranged to fetch his little daughter away and was just now standing and talking with uncle for they had much to say to one another
clara felt somewhat consoled by heidis words and wiped away her tears
be sure you say goodbye for me to peter and the goats and especially to little swan
i wish i could give little swan a present for she has helped so much to make me strong
well you can if you like replied heidi send her a little salt you know how she likes to lick some out of grandfathers hand when she comes home at night
clara was delighted at this idea
oh then i shall send a hundred pounds of salt from frankfurt for i want her to have something as a remembrance of me
herr sesemann now beckoned to the children as it was time to be off
grandmammas white horse had been brought up for clara as she was no longer obliged to be carried in a chair
heidi ran to the far edge of the slope and continued to wave her hand to clara until the last glimpse of horse and rider had disappeared
and now the bed has arrived and grandmother is sleeping so soundly all night that she is sure to grow stronger
grandmamma moreover has not forgotten how cold the winter is on the mountain
she has sent a large parcel of warm clothing of every description so that grandmother can wrap herself round and round and will certainly not tremble with cold now as she sits in her corner
there is a great deal of building going on at dorfli
the doctor has arrived and for the present is occupying his old quarters
his friends have advised him to buy the old house that uncle and heidi live in during the winter which had evidently judging from the height of the rooms and the magnificent stove with its artisticallypainted tiles been a fine gentlemans place at one time
the doctor is having this part of the old house rebuilt for himself the other part being repaired for uncle and heidi for the doctor is aware that uncle is a man of independent spirit who likes to have a house to himself
quite at the back a warm and wellwalled stall is being put up for the two goats and there they will pass their winter in comfort
the doctor and uncle are becoming better friends every day and as they walk about the new buildings to see how they are getting on their thoughts continually turn to heidi for the chief pleasure to each in connection with the house is that they will have the lighthearted little child with them there
dear friend said the doctor on one of these occasions as they were standing together you will see this matter in the same light as i do i am sure
i share your happiness in the child as if next to you i was the one to whom she most closely belonged but i wish also to share all responsibilities concerning her and to do my best for the child
i shall then feel i have my rights in her and shall look forward to her being with me and caring for me in my old age which is the one great wish of my heart
she will have the same claims upon me as if she were my own child and i shall provide for her as such and so we shall be able to leave her without anxiety when the day comes that you and i must go
uncle did not speak but he clasped the doctors hand in his and his good friend could read in the old mans eyes how greatly moved he was and how glad and grateful he felt
heidi and peter were at this moment sitting with grandmother and the one had so much to relate and the others to listen to that they all three got closer and closer to one another hardly able to breathe in their eagerness not to miss a word
and how much there was to tell of all the events that had taken place that last summer for they had not had many opportunities of meeting since then
and it was difficult to say which of the three looked the happiest at being together again and at the recollection of all the wonderful things that had happened
mother brigittas face was perhaps the happiest of all as now with the help of explanation she was able to understand for the first time the history of peters weekly penny for life
then at last the grandmother spoke heidi read me one of the hymns
i can feel i can do nothing for the remainder of my life but thank the father in heaven for all the mercies he has shown us
3 may
bistritz
left munich at 835 pm on 1st may arriving at vienna early next morning should have arrived at 646 but train was an hour late
budapesth seems a wonderful place from the glimpse which i got of it from the train and the little i could walk through the streets
i feared to go very far from the station as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible
the impression i had was that we were leaving the west and entering the east the most western of splendid bridges over the danube which is here of noble width and depth took us among the traditions of turkish rule
we left in pretty good time and came after nightfall to klausenburgh
here i stopped for the night at the hotel royale
i had for dinner or rather supper a chicken done up some way with red pepper which was very good but thirsty
mem
get recipe for mina
i asked the waiter and he said it was called paprika hendl and that as it was a national dish i should be able to get it anywhere along the carpathians
i found my smattering of german very useful here indeed i dont know how i should be able to get on without it
having had some time at my disposal when in london i had visited the british museum and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding transylvania it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country
i find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country just on the borders of three states transylvania moldavia and bukovina in the midst of the carpathian mountains one of the wildest and least known portions of europe
i was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the castle dracula as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own ordnance survey maps but i found that bistritz the post town named by count dracula is a fairly wellknown place
i shall enter here some of my notes as they may refresh my memory when i talk over my travels with mina
in the population of transylvania there are four distinct nationalities saxons in the south and mixed with them the wallachs who are the descendants of the dacians magyars in the west and szekelys in the east and north
i am going among the latter who claim to be descended from attila and the huns
this may be so for when the magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the huns settled in it
i read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the carpathians as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool if so my stay may be very interesting
i must ask the count all about them
i did not sleep well though my bed was comfortable enough for i had all sorts of queer dreams
there was a dog howling all night under my window which may have had something to do with it or it may have been the paprika for i had to drink up all the water in my carafe and was still thirsty
towards morning i slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door so i guess i must have been sleeping soundly then
i had for breakfast more paprika and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was mamaliga and eggplant stuffed with forcemeat a very excellent dish which they call impletata
get recipe for this also
i had to hurry breakfast for the train started a little before eight or rather it ought to have done so for after rushing to the station at 730 i had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move
it seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains
what ought they to be in china
all day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind
sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods
it takes a lot of water and running strong to sweep the outside edge of a river clear
at every station there were groups of people sometimes crowds and in all sorts of attire
some of them were just like the peasants at home or those i saw coming through france and germany with short jackets and round hats and homemade trousers but others were very picturesque
the women looked pretty except when you got near them but they were very clumsy about the waist
they had all full white sleeves of some kind or other and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet but of course there were petticoats under them
the strangest figures we saw were the slovaks who were more barbarian than the rest with their big cowboy hats great baggy dirtywhite trousers white linen shirts and enormous heavy leather belts nearly a foot wide all studded over with brass nails
they wore high boots with their trousers tucked into them and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches
they are very picturesque but do not look prepossessing
on the stage they would be set down at once as some old oriental band of brigands
they are however i am told very harmless and rather wanting in natural selfassertion
it was on the dark side of twilight when we got to bistritz which is a very interesting old place
being practically on the frontierfor the borgo pass leads from it into bukovinait has had a very stormy existence and it certainly shows marks of it
fifty years ago a series of great fires took place which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions
at the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13000 people the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease
count dracula had directed me to go to the golden krone hotel which i found to my great delight to be thoroughly oldfashioned for of course i wanted to see all i could of the ways of the country
i was evidently expected for when i got near the door i faced a cheerylooking elderly woman in the usual peasant dresswhite undergarment with long double apron front and back of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty
when i came close she bowed and said the herr englishman
yes i said jonathan harker
she smiled and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirtsleeves who had followed her to the door
he went but immediately returned with a letter my friend
welcome to the carpathians
i am anxiously expecting you
sleep well tonight
at three tomorrow the diligence will start for bukovina a place on it is kept for you
at the borgo pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me
i trust that your journey from london has been a happy one and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land
your friend dracula
4 may
i found that my landlord had got a letter from the count directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent and pretended that he could not understand my german
this could not be true because up to then he had understood it perfectly at least he answered my questions exactly as if he did
he and his wife the old lady who had received me looked at each other in a frightened sort of way
he mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter and that was all he knew
when i asked him if he knew count dracula and could tell me anything of his castle both he and his wife crossed themselves and saying that they knew nothing at all simply refused to speak further
it was so near the time of starting that i had no time to ask any one else for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting
just before i was leaving the old lady came up to my room and said in a very hysterical way must you go
young herr must you go
she was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what german she knew and mixed it all up with some other language which i did not know at all
i was just able to follow her by asking many questions
when i told her that i must go at once and that i was engaged on important business she asked again do you know what day it is
i answered that it was the fourth of may
she shook her head as she said again oh yes
i know that
i know that but do you know what day it is
on my saying that i did not understand she went on it is the eve of st
georges day
do you not know that tonight when the clock strikes midnight all the evil things in the world will have full sway
do you know where you are going and what you are going to
she was in such evident distress that i tried to comfort her but without effect
finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go at least to wait a day or two before starting
it was all very ridiculous but i did not feel comfortable
however there was business to be done and i could allow nothing to interfere with it
i therefore tried to raise her up and said as gravely as i could that i thanked her but my duty was imperative and that i must go
she then rose and dried her eyes and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me
i did not know what to do for as an english churchman i have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind
she saw i suppose the doubt in my face for she put the rosary round my neck and said for your mothers sake and went out of the room
i am writing up this part of the diary whilst i am waiting for the coach which is of course late and the crucifix is still round my neck
whether it is the old ladys fear or the many ghostly traditions of this place or the crucifix itself i do not know but i am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual
if this book should ever reach mina before i do let it bring my goodbye
here comes the coach
5 may
the castle
the grey of the morning has passed and the sun is high over the distant horizon which seems jagged whether with trees or hills i know not for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed
i am not sleepy and as i am not to be called till i awake naturally i write till sleep comes
there are many odd things to put down and lest who reads them may fancy that i dined too well before i left bistritz let me put down my dinner exactly
i dined on what they called robber steakbits of bacon onion and beef seasoned with red pepper and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire in the simple style of the london cats meat
the wine was golden mediasch which produces a queer sting on the tongue which is however not disagreeable
i had only a couple of glasses of this and nothing else
when i got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat and i saw him talking with the landlady
they were evidently talking of me for every now and then they looked at me and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the doorwhich they call by a name meaning wordbearercame and listened and then looked at me most of them pityingly
i could hear a lot of words often repeated queer words for there were many nationalities in the crowd so i quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out
i must say they were not cheering to me for amongst them were ordogsatan pokolhell stregoicawitch vrolok and vlkoslakboth of which mean the same thing one being slovak and the other servian for something that is either werewolf or vampire
i must ask the count about these superstitions when we started the crowd round the inn door which had by this time swelled to a considerable size all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me
with some difficulty i got a fellowpassenger to tell me what they meant he would not answer at first but on learning that i was english he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye
this was not very pleasant for me just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man but every one seemed so kindhearted and so sorrowful and so sympathetic that i could not but be touched
i shall never forget the last glimpse which i had of the innyard and its crowd of picturesque figures all crossing themselves as they stood round the wide archway with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard
then our driver whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the boxseatgotza they call themcracked his big whip over his four small horses which ran abreast and we set off on our journey
i soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along although had i known the language or rather languages which my fellowpassengers were speaking i might not have been able to throw them off so easily
before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods with here and there steep hills crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses the blank gable end to the road
there was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossomapple plum pear cherry and as we drove by i could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals
in and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the mittel land ran the road losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame
the road was rugged but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste
i could not understand then what the haste meant but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching borgo prund
i was told that this road is in summertime excellent but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows
in this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the carpathians for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order
of old the hospadars would not repair them lest the turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point
beyond the green swelling hills of the mittel land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the carpathians themselves
right and left of us they towered with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks green and brown where grass and rock mingled and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags till these were themselves lost in the distance where the snowy peaks rose grandly
here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains through which as the sun began to sink we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water
one of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty snowcovered peak of a mountain which seemed as we wound on our serpentine way to be right before us look
isten szek
gods seat
and he crossed himself reverently
as we wound on our endless way and the sun sank lower and lower behind us the shadows of the evening began to creep round us
this was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountaintop still held the sunset and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink
here and there we passed cszeks and slovaks all in picturesque attire but i noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent
by the roadside were many crosses and as we swept by my companions all crossed themselves
here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine who did not even turn round as we approached but seemed in the selfsurrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world
there were many things new to me for instance hayricks in the trees and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves
now and again we passed a leiterwagonthe ordinary peasants cartwith its long snakelike vertebra calculated to suit the inequalities of the road
on this were sure to be seated quite a group of homecoming peasants the cszeks with their white and the slovaks with their coloured sheepskins the latter carrying lancefashion their long staves with axe at end
as the evening fell it began to get very cold and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees oak beech and pine though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills as we ascended through the pass the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of latelying snow
sometimes as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us great masses of greyness which here and there bestrewed the trees produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghostlike clouds which amongst the carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys
sometimes the hills were so steep that despite our drivers haste the horses could only go slowly
i wished to get down and walk up them as we do at home but the driver would not hear of it
no no he said you must not walk here the dogs are too fierce and then he added with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantryfor he looked round to catch the approving smile of the restand you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep
the only stop he would make was a moments pause to light his lamps
when it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers and they kept speaking to him one after the other as though urging him to further speed
he lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions
then through the darkness i could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us as though there were a cleft in the hills
the excitement of the passengers grew greater the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea
i had to hold on
the road grew more level and we appeared to fly along
then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us we were entering on the borgo pass
one by one several of the passengers offered me gifts which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial these were certainly of an odd and varied kind but each was given in simple good faith with a kindly word and a blessing and that strange mixture of fearmeaning movements which i had seen outside the hotel at bistritzthe sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye
then as we flew along the driver leaned forward and on each side the passengers craning over the edge of the coach peered eagerly into the darkness
it was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected but though i asked each passenger no one would give me the slightest explanation
this state of excitement kept on for some little time and at last we saw before us the pass opening out on the eastern side
there were dark rolling clouds overhead and in the air the heavy oppressive sense of thunder
it seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres and that now we had got into the thunderous one
i was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the count
each moment i expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness but all was dark
the only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps in which the steam from our harddriven horses rose in a white cloud
we could see now the sandy road lying white before us but there was on it no sign of a vehicle
the passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness which seemed to mock my own disappointment
i was already thinking what i had best do when the driver looking at his watch said to the others something which i could hardly hear it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone i thought it was an hour less than the time
then turning to me he said in german worse than my own there is no carriage here
the herr is not expected after all
he will now come on to bukovina and return tomorrow or the next day better the next day
whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly so that the driver had to hold them up
then amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves a calche with four horses drove up behind us overtook us and drew up beside the coach
i could see from the flash of our lamps as the rays fell on them that the horses were coalblack and splendid animals
they were driven by a tall man with a long brown beard and a great black hat which seemed to hide his face from us
i could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes which seemed red in the lamplight as he turned to us
he said to the driver you are early tonight my friend
the man stammered in reply the english herr was in a hurry to which the stranger replied that is why i suppose you wished him to go on to bukovina
you cannot deceive me my friend i know too much and my horses are swift
as he spoke he smiled and the lamplight fell on a hardlooking mouth with very red lips and sharplooking teeth as white as ivory
one of my companions whispered to another the line from burgers lenore denn die todten reiten schnell for the dead travel fast
the strange driver evidently heard the words for he looked up with a gleaming smile
the passenger turned his face away at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself
give me the herrs luggage said the driver and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the calche
then i descended from the side of the coach as the calche was close alongside the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel his strength must have been prodigious
without a word he shook his reins the horses turned and we swept into the darkness of the pass
as i looked back i saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves
then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses and off they swept on their way to bukovina
as they sank into the darkness i felt a strange chill and a lonely feeling came over me but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders and a rug across my knees and the driver said in excellent german the night is chill mein herr and my master the count bade me take all care of you
there is a flask of slivovitz the plum brandy of the country underneath the seat if you should require it
i did not take any but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same
i felt a little strangely and not a little frightened
i think had there been any alternative i should have taken it instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey
the carriage went at a hard pace straight along then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road
it seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again and so i took note of some salient point and found that this was so
i would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant but i really feared to do so for i thought that placed as i was any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay
byandby however as i was curious to know how time was passing i struck a match and by its flame looked at my watch it was within a few minutes of midnight
this gave me a sort of shock for i suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences
i waited with a sick feeling of suspense
then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the roada long agonised wailing as if from fear
the sound was taken up by another dog and then another and another till borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the pass a wild howling began which seemed to come from all over the country as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night
at the first howl the horses began to strain and rear but the driver spoke to them soothingly and they quieted down but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright
then far off in the distance from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howlingthat of wolveswhich affected both the horses and myself in the same wayfor i was minded to jump from the calche and run whilst they reared again and plunged madly so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting
in a few minutes however my own ears got accustomed to the sound and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them
he petted and soothed them and whispered something in their ears as i have heard of horsetamers doing and with extraordinary effect for under his caresses they became quite manageable again though they still trembled
the driver again took his seat and shaking his reins started off at a great pace
this time after going to the far side of the pass he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right
soon we were hemmed in with trees which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side
though we were in shelter we could hear the rising wind for it moaned and whistled through the rocks and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along
it grew colder and colder still and fine powdery snow began to fall so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket
the keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs though this grew fainter as we went on our way
the baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer as though they were closing round on us from every side
i grew dreadfully afraid and the horses shared my fear
the driver however was not in the least disturbed he kept turning his head to left and right but i could not see anything through the darkness
suddenly away on our left i saw a faint flickering blue flame
the driver saw it at the same moment he at once checked the horses and jumping to the ground disappeared into the darkness
i did not know what to do the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer but while i wondered the driver suddenly appeared again and without a word took his seat and we resumed our journey
i think i must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident for it seemed to be repeated endlessly and now looking back it is like a sort of awful nightmare
once the flame appeared so near the road that even in the darkness around us i could watch the drivers motions
he went rapidly to where the blue flame aroseit must have been very faint for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at alland gathering a few stones formed them into some device
once there appeared a strange optical effect when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it for i could see its ghostly flicker all the same
this startled me but as the effect was only momentary i took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness
then for a time there were no blue flames and we sped onwards through the gloom with the howling of the wolves around us as though they were following in a moving circle
at last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone and during his absence the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright
i could not see any cause for it for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether but just then the moon sailing through the black clouds appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling pineclad rock and by its light i saw around us a ring of wolves with white teeth and lolling red tongues with long sinewy limbs and shaggy hair
they were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled
for myself i felt a sort of paralysis of fear
it is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import
all at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them
the horses jumped about and reared and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side and they had perforce to remain within it
i called to the coachman to come for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach
i shouted and beat the side of the calche hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap
how he came there i know not but i heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command and looking towards the sound saw him stand in the roadway
as he swept his long arms as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle the wolves fell back and back further still
just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon so that we were again in darkness
when i could see again the driver was climbing into the calche and the wolves had disappeared
this was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me and i was afraid to speak or move
the time seemed interminable as we swept on our way now in almost complete darkness for the rolling clouds obscured the moon
we kept on ascending with occasional periods of quick descent but in the main always ascending
suddenly i became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle from whose tall black windows came no ray of light and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky
i must have been asleep for certainly if i had been fully awake i must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place
in the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is
i have not yet been able to see it by daylight
when the calche stopped the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to alight
again i could not but notice his prodigious strength
his hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen
then he took out my traps and placed them on the ground beside me as i stood close to a great door old and studded with large iron nails and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone
i could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather
as i stood the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the reins the horses started forward and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings
i stood in silence where i was for i did not know what to do
of bell or knocker there was no sign through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate
the time i waited seemed endless and i felt doubts and fears crowding upon me
what sort of place had i come to and among what kind of people
what sort of grim adventure was it on which i had embarked
was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitors clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a london estate to a foreigner
solicitors clerk
mina would not like that
solicitorfor just before leaving london i got word that my examination was successful and i am now a fullblown solicitor
i began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if i were awake
it all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me and i expected that i should suddenly awake and find myself at home with the dawn struggling in through the windows as i had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork
but my flesh answered the pinching test and my eyes were not to be deceived
i was indeed awake and among the carpathians
all i could do now was to be patient and to wait the coming of the morning
just as i had come to this conclusion i heard a heavy step approaching behind the great door and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light
then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back
a key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse and the great door swung back
within stood a tall old man clean shaven save for a long white moustache and clad in black from head to foot without a single speck of colour about him anywhere
he held in his hand an antique silver lamp in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door
the old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly gesture saying in excellent english but with a strange intonation welcome to my house
enter freely and of your own will
he made no motion of stepping to meet me but stood like a statue as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone
the instant however that i had stepped over the threshold he moved impulsively forward and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as icemore like the hand of a dead than a living man
again he said welcome to my house
come freely
go safely and leave something of the happiness you bring
the strength of the handshake was so much akin to that which i had noticed in the driver whose face i had not seen that for a moment i doubted if it were not the same person to whom i was speaking so to make sure i said interrogatively count dracula
he bowed in a courtly way as he replied i am dracula and i bid you welcome mr harker to my house
come in the night air is chill and you must need to eat and rest
as he was speaking he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall and stepping out took my luggage he had carried it in before i could forestall him
i protested but he insisted nay sir you are my guest
it is late and my people are not available
let me see to your comfort myself
he insisted on carrying my traps along the passage and then up a great winding stair and along another great passage on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily
at the end of this he threw open a heavy door and i rejoiced to see within a welllit room in which a table was spread for supper and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs freshly replenished flamed and flared
the count halted putting down my bags closed the door and crossing the room opened another door which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp and seemingly without a window of any sort
passing through this he opened another door and motioned me to enter
it was a welcome sight for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log firealso added to but lately for the top logs were freshwhich sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney
the count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew saying before he closed the door you will need after your journey to refresh yourself by making your toilet
i trust you will find all you wish
when you are ready come into the other room where you will find your supper prepared
the light and warmth and the counts courteous welcome seemed to have dissipated all my doubts and fears
having then reached my normal state i discovered that i was half famished with hunger so making a hasty toilet i went into the other room
i found supper already laid out
my host who stood on one side of the great fireplace leaning against the stonework made a graceful wave of his hand to the table and said i pray you be seated and sup how you please
you will i trust excuse me that i do not join you but i have dined already and i do not sup
i handed to him the sealed letter which mr hawkins had entrusted to me
he opened it and read it gravely then with a charming smile he handed it to me to read
one passage of it at least gave me a thrill of pleasure
i must regret that an attack of gout from which malady i am a constant sufferer forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to come but i am happy to say i can send a sufficient substitute one in whom i have every possible confidence
he is a young man full of energy and talent in his own way and of a very faithful disposition
he is discreet and silent and has grown into manhood in my service
he shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay and shall take your instructions in all matters
the count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish and i fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken
this with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old tokay of which i had two glasses was my supper
during the time i was eating it the count asked me many questions as to my journey and i told him by degrees all i had experienced
by this time i had finished my supper and by my hosts desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke
i had now an opportunity of observing him and found him of a very marked physiognomy
his face was a stronga very strongaquiline with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils with lofty domed forehead and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere
his eyebrows were very massive almost meeting over the nose and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion
the mouth so far as i could see it under the heavy moustache was fixed and rather cruellooking with peculiarly sharp white teeth these protruded over the lips whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years
for the rest his ears were pale and at the tops extremely pointed the chin was broad and strong and the cheeks firm though thin
the general effect was one of extraordinary pallor
hitherto i had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees in the firelight and they had seemed rather white and fine but seeing them now close to me i could not but notice that they were rather coarsebroad with squat fingers
strange to say there were hairs in the centre of the palm
the nails were long and fine and cut to a sharp point
as the count leaned over me and his hands touched me i could not repress a shudder
it may have been that his breath was rank but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me which do what i would i could not conceal
the count evidently noticing it drew back and with a grim sort of smile which showed more than he had yet done his protuberant teeth sat himself down again on his own side of the fireplace
we were both silent for a while and as i looked towards the window i saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn
there seemed a strange stillness over everything but as i listened i heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves
the counts eyes gleamed and he said listen to themthe children of the night
what music they make
seeing i suppose some expression in my face strange to him he added ah sir you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter
then he rose and said but you must be tired
your bedroom is all ready and tomorrow you shall sleep as late as you will
i have to be away till the afternoon so sleep well and dream well
with a courteous bow he opened for me himself the door to the octagonal room and i entered my bedroom
i am all in a sea of wonders
i doubt i fear i think strange things which i dare not confess to my own soul
god keep me if only for the sake of those dear to me
7 may
it is again early morning but i have rested and enjoyed the last twentyfour hours
i slept till late in the day and awoke of my own accord
when i had dressed myself i went into the room where we had supped and found a cold breakfast laid out with coffee kept hot by the pot being placed on the hearth
there was a card on the table on which was written i have to be absent for a while
do not wait for me
d
i set to and enjoyed a hearty meal
when i had done i looked for a bell so that i might let the servants know i had finished but i could not find one
there are certainly odd deficiencies in the house considering the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me
the table service is of gold and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value
the curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics and must have been of fabulous value when they were made for they are centuries old though in excellent order
i saw something like them in hampton court but there they were worn and frayed and motheaten
but still in none of the rooms is there a mirror
there is not even a toilet glass on my table and i had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before i could either shave or brush my hair
i have not yet seen a servant anywhere or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves
some time after i had finished my meali do not know whether to call it breakfast or dinner for it was between five and six oclock when i had iti looked about for something to read for i did not like to go about the castle until i had asked the counts permission
there was absolutely nothing in the room book newspaper or even writing materials so i opened another door in the room and found a sort of library
the door opposite mine i tried but found it locked
in the library i found to my great delight a vast number of english books whole shelves full of them and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers
a table in the centre was littered with english magazines and newspapers though none of them were of very recent date
the books were of the most varied kindhistory geography politics political economy botany geology lawall relating to england and english life and customs and manners
there were even such books of reference as the london directory the red and blue books whitakers almanac the army and navy lists andit somehow gladdened my heart to see itthe law list
whilst i was looking at the books the door opened and the count entered
he saluted me in a hearty way and hoped that i had had a good nights rest
then he went on i am glad you found your way in here for i am sure there is much that will interest you
these companionsand he laid his hand on some of the bookshave been good friends to me and for some years past ever since i had the idea of going to london have given me many many hours of pleasure
through them i have come to know your great england and to know her is to love her
i long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty london to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity to share its life its change its death and all that makes it what it is
but alas
as yet i only know your tongue through books
to you my friend i look that i know it to speak
but count i said you know and speak english thoroughly
he bowed gravely
i thank you my friend for your all tooflattering estimate but yet i fear that i am but a little way on the road i would travel
true i know the grammar and the words but yet i know not how to speak them
indeed i said you speak excellently
not so he answered
well i know that did i move and speak in your london none there are who would not know me for a stranger
that is not enough for me
here i am noble i am boyar the common people know me and i am master
but a stranger in a strange land he is no one men know him notand to know not is to care not for
i am content if i am like the rest so that no man stops if he see me or pause in his speaking if he hear my words ha ha
a stranger
i have been so long master that i would be master stillor at least that none other should be master of me
you come to me not alone as agent of my friend peter hawkins of exeter to tell me all about my new estate in london
you shall i trust rest here with me awhile so that by our talking i may learn the english intonation and i would that you tell me when i make error even of the smallest in my speaking
i am sorry that i had to be away so long today but you will i know forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand
of course i said all i could about being willing and asked if i might come into that room when i chose
he answered yes certainly and added you may go anywhere you wish in the castle except where the doors are locked where of course you will not wish to go
there is reason that all things are as they are and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge you would perhaps better understand
i said i was sure of this and then he went on we are in transylvania and transylvania is not england
our ways are not your ways and there shall be to you many strange things
nay from what you have told me of your experiences already you know something of what strange things there may be
this led to much conversation and as it was evident that he wanted to talk if only for talkings sake i asked him many questions regarding things that had already happened to me or come within my notice
sometimes he sheered off the subject or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand but generally he answered all i asked most frankly
then as time went on and i had got somewhat bolder i asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night as for instance why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames
he then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the yearlast night in fact when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked swaya blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed
that treasure has been hidden he went on in the region through which you came last night there can be but little doubt for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the wallachian the saxon and the turk
why there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men patriots or invaders
in old days there were stirring times when the austrian and the hungarian came up in hordes and the patriots went out to meet themmen and women the aged and the children tooand waited their coming on the rocks above the passes that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches
when the invader was triumphant he found but little for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil
but how said i can it have remained so long undiscovered when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look
the count smiled and as his lips ran back over his gums the long sharp canine teeth showed out strangely he answered because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool
those flames only appear on one night and on that night no man of this land will if he can help it stir without his doors
and dear sir even if he did he would not know what to do
why even the peasant that you tell me of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for his own work
even you would not i dare be sworn be able to find these places again
there you are right i said
i know no more than the dead where even to look for them
then we drifted into other matters
come he said at last tell me of london and of the house which you have procured for me
with an apology for my remissness i went into my own room to get the papers from my bag
whilst i was placing them in order i heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room and as i passed through noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit for it was by this time deep into the dark
the lamps were also lit in the study or library and i found the count lying on the sofa reading of all things in the world an english bradshaws guide
when i came in he cleared the books and papers from the table and with him i went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts
he was interested in everything and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings
he clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood for he evidently at the end knew very much more than i did
when i remarked this he answered well but my friend is it not needful that i should
when i go there i shall be all alone and my friend harker jonathannay pardon me i fall into my countrys habit of putting your patronymic firstmy friend jonathan harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me
he will be in exeter miles away probably working at papers of the law with my other friend peter hawkins
so
we went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at purfleet
when i had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary papers and had written a letter with them ready to post to mr hawkins he began to ask me how i had come across so suitable a place
i read to him the notes which i had made at the time and which i inscribe here at purfleet on a byroad i came across just such a place as seemed to be required and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale
it is surrounded by a high wall of ancient structure built of heavy stones and has not been repaired for a large number of years
the closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron all eaten with rust
the estate is called carfax no doubt a corruption of the old quatre face as the house is foursided agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass
it contains in all some twenty acres quite surrounded by the solid stone wall above mentioned
there are many trees on it which make it in places gloomy and there is a deep darklooking pond or small lake evidently fed by some springs as the water is clear and flows away in a fairsized stream
the house is very large and of all periods back i should say to medival times for one part is of stone immensely thick with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron
it looks like part of a keep and is close to an old chapel or church
i could not enter it as i had not the key of the door leading to it from the house but i have taken with my kodak views of it from various points
the house has been added to but in a very straggling way and i can only guess at the amount of ground it covers which must be very great
there are but few houses close at hand one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum
it is not however visible from the grounds
when i had finished he said i am glad that it is old and big
i myself am of an old family and to live in a new house would kill me
a house cannot be made habitable in a day and after all how few days go to make up a century
i rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times
we transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead
i seek not gaiety nor mirth not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please the young and gay
i am no longer young and my heart through weary years of mourning over the dead is not attuned to mirth
moreover the walls of my castle are broken the shadows are many and the wind breathes cold through the broken battlements and casements
i love the shade and the shadow and would be alone with my thoughts when i may
somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord or else it was that his cast of face made his smile look malignant and saturnine
presently with an excuse he left me asking me to put all my papers together
he was some little time away and i began to look at some of the books around me
one was an atlas which i found opened naturally at england as if that map had been much used
on looking at it i found in certain places little rings marked and on examining these i noticed that one was near london on the east side manifestly where his new estate was situated the other two were exeter and whitby on the yorkshire coast
it was the better part of an hour when the count returned
aha
he said still at your books
good
but you must not work always
come i am informed that your supper is ready
he took my arm and we went into the next room where i found an excellent supper ready on the table
the count again excused himself as he had dined out on his being away from home
but he sat as on the previous night and chatted whilst i ate
after supper i smoked as on the last evening and the count stayed with me chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject hour after hour
i felt that it was getting very late indeed but i did not say anything for i felt under obligation to meet my hosts wishes in every way
i was not sleepy as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me but i could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn which is like in its way the turn of the tide
they say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide any one who has when tired and tied as it were to his post experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it
all at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air count dracula jumping to his feet said why there is the morning again
how remiss i am to let you stay up so long
you must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of england less interesting so that i may not forget how time flies by us and with a courtly bow he quickly left me
i went into my own room and drew the curtains but there was little to notice my window opened into the courtyard all i could see was the warm grey of quickening sky
so i pulled the curtains again and have written of this day
8 may
i began to fear as i wrote in this book that i was getting too diffuse but now i am glad that i went into detail from the first for there is something so strange about this place and all in it that i cannot but feel uneasy
i wish i were safe out of it or that i had never come
it may be that this strange nightexistence is telling on me but would that that were all
if there were any one to talk to i could bear it but there is no one
i have only the count to speak with and he
i fear i am myself the only living soul within the place
let me be prosaic so far as facts can be it will help me to bear up and imagination must not run riot with me
if it does i am lost
let me say at once how i standor seem to
i only slept a few hours when i went to bed and feeling that i could not sleep any more got up
i had hung my shaving glass by the window and was just beginning to shave
suddenly i felt a hand on my shoulder and heard the counts voice saying to me goodmorning
i started for it amazed me that i had not seen him since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me
in starting i had cut myself slightly but did not notice it at the moment
having answered the counts salutation i turned to the glass again to see how i had been mistaken
this time there could be no error for the man was close to me and i could see him over my shoulder
but there was no reflection of him in the mirror
the whole room behind me was displayed but there was no sign of a man in it except myself
this was startling and coming on the top of so many strange things was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which i always have when the count is near but at the instant i saw that the cut had bled a little and the blood was trickling over my chin
i laid down the razor turning as i did so half round to look for some sticking plaster
when the count saw my face his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury and he suddenly made a grab at my throat
i drew away and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix
it made an instant change in him for the fury passed so quickly that i could hardly believe that it was ever there
take care he said take care how you cut yourself
it is more dangerous than you think in this country
then seizing the shaving glass he went on and this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief
it is a foul bauble of mans vanity
away with it
and opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand he flung out the glass which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below
then he withdrew without a word
it is very annoying for i do not see how i am to shave unless in my watchcase or the bottom of the shavingpot which is fortunately of metal
when i went into the diningroom breakfast was prepared but i could not find the count anywhere
so i breakfasted alone
it is strange that as yet i have not seen the count eat or drink
he must be a very peculiar man
after breakfast i did a little exploring in the castle
i went out on the stairs and found a room looking towards the south
the view was magnificent and from where i stood there was every opportunity of seeing it
the castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice
a stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything
as far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm
here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests
but i am not in heart to describe beauty for when i had seen the view i explored further doors doors doors everywhere and all locked and bolted
in no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit
the castle is a veritable prison and i am a prisoner
when i found that i was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me
i rushed up and down the stairs trying every door and peering out of every window i could find but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings
when i look back after a few hours i think i must have been mad for the time for i behaved much as a rat does in a trap
when however the conviction had come to me that i was helpless i sat down quietlyas quietly as i have ever done anything in my lifeand began to think over what was best to be done
i am thinking still and as yet have come to no definite conclusion
of one thing only am i certain that it is no use making my ideas known to the count
he knows well that i am imprisoned and as he has done it himself and has doubtless his own motives for it he would only deceive me if i trusted him fully with the facts
so far as i can see my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself and my eyes open
i am i know either being deceived like a baby by my own fears or else i am in desperate straits and if the latter be so i need and shall need all my brains to get through
i had hardly come to this conclusion when i heard the great door below shut and knew that the count had returned
he did not come at once into the library so i went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed
this was odd but only confirmed what i had all along thoughtthat there were no servants in the house
when later i saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the diningroom i was assured of it for if he does himself all these menial offices surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them
this gave me a fright for if there is no one else in the castle it must have been the count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here
this is a terrible thought for if so what does it mean that he could control the wolves as he did by only holding up his hand in silence
how was it that all the people at bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me
what meant the giving of the crucifix of the garlic of the wild rose of the mountain ash
bless that good good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck
for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever i touch it
it is odd that a thing which i have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help
is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself or that it is a medium a tangible help in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort
some time if it may be i must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it
in the meantime i must find out all i can about count dracula as it may help me to understand
tonight he may talk of himself if i turn the conversation that way
i must be very careful however not to awake his suspicion
midnight
i have had a long talk with the count
i asked him a few questions on transylvania history and he warmed up to the subject wonderfully
in his speaking of things and people and especially of battles he spoke as if he had been present at them all
this he afterwards explained by saying that to a boyar the pride of his house and name is his own pride that their glory is his glory that their fate is his fate
whenever he spoke of his house he always said we and spoke almost in the plural like a king speaking
i wish i could put down all he said exactly as he said it for to me it was most fascinating
it seemed to have in it a whole history of the country
he grew excited as he spoke and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength
one thing he said which i shall put down as nearly as i can for it tells in its way the story of his race we szekelys have a right to be proud for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights for lordship
here in the whirlpool of european races the ugric tribe bore down from iceland the fighting spirit which thor and wodin gave them which their berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of europe ay and of asia and africa too till the peoples thought that the werewolves themselves had come
here too when they came they found the huns whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches who expelled from scythia had mated with the devils in the desert
fools fools
what devil or what witch was ever so great as attila whose blood is in these veins
he held up his arms
is it a wonder that we were a conquering race that we were proud that when the magyar the lombard the avar the bulgar or the turk poured his thousands on our frontiers we drove them back
is it strange that when arpad and his legions swept through the hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier that the honfoglalas was completed there
and when the hungarian flood swept eastward the szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious magyars and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of turkeyland ay and more than that endless duty of the frontier guard for as the turks say water sleeps and enemy is sleepless
who more gladly than we throughout the four nations received the bloody sword or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the king
when was redeemed that great shame of my nation the shame of cassova when the flags of the wallach and the magyar went down beneath the crescent
who was it but one of my own race who as voivode crossed the danube and beat the turk on his own ground
this was a dracula indeed
woe was it that his own unworthy brother when he had fallen sold his people to the turk and brought the shame of slavery on them
was it not this dracula indeed who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into turkeyland who when he was beaten back came again and again and again though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph
they said that he thought only of himself
bah
what good are peasants without a leader
where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it
again when after the battle of mohcs we threw off the hungarian yoke we of the dracula blood were amongst their leaders for our spirit would not brook that we were not free
ah young sir the szekelysand the dracula as their hearts blood their brains and their swordscan boast a record that mushroom growths like the hapsburgs and the romanoffs can never reach
the warlike days are over
blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told
it was by this time close on morning and we went to bed
this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the arabian nights for everything has to break off at cockcrowor like the ghost of hamlets father
12 may
let me begin with factsbare meagre facts verified by books and figures and of which there can be no doubt
i must not confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own observation or my memory of them
last evening when the count came from his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business
i had spent the day wearily over books and simply to keep my mind occupied went over some of the matters i had been examining at lincolns inn
there was a certain method in the counts inquiries so i shall try to put them down in sequence the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me
first he asked if a man in england might have two solicitors or more
i told him he might have a dozen if he wished but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction as only one could act at a time and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest
he seemed thoroughly to understand and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend say to banking and another to look after shipping in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor
i asked him to explain more fully so that i might not by any chance mislead him so he said i shall illustrate
your friend and mine mr peter hawkins from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at exeter which is far from london buys for me through your good self my place at london
now here let me say frankly lest you should think it strange that i have sought the services of one so far off from london instead of some one resident there that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only and as one of london residence might perhaps have some purpose of himself or friend to serve i went thus afield to seek my agent whose labours should be only to my interest
now suppose i who have much of affairs wish to ship goods say to newcastle or durham or harwich or dover might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports
i answered that certainly it would be most easy but that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor so that the client simply placing himself in the hands of one man could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble
but said he i could be at liberty to direct myself
is it not so
of course i replied and such is often done by men of business who do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person
he said and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments and the forms to be gone through and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise but by forethought could be guarded against
i explained all these things to him to the best of my ability and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor for there was nothing that he did not think of or foresee
for a man who was never in the country and who did not evidently do much in the way of business his knowledge and acumen were wonderful
when he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken and i had verified all as well as i could by the books available he suddenly stood up and said have you written since your first letter to our friend mr peter hawkins or to any other
it was with some bitterness in my heart that i answered that i had not that as yet i had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody
then write now my young friend he said laying a heavy hand on my shoulder write to our friend and to any other and say if it will please you that you shall stay with me until a month from now
do you wish me to stay so long
i asked for my heart grew cold at the thought
i desire it much nay i will take no refusal
when your master employer what you will engaged that someone should come on his behalf it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted
i have not stinted
what could i do but bow acceptance
it was mr hawkinss interest not mine and i had to think of him not myself and besides while count dracula was speaking there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that i was a prisoner and that if i wished it i could have no choice
the count saw his victory in my bow and his mastery in the trouble of my face for he began at once to use them but in his own smooth resistless way i pray you my good young friend that you will not discourse of things other than business in your letters
it will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well and that you look forward to getting home to them
as he spoke he handed me three sheets of notepaper and three envelopes
they were all of the thinnest foreign post and looking at them then at him and noticing his quiet smile with the sharp canine teeth lying over the red underlip i understood as well as if he had spoken that i should be careful what i wrote for he would be able to read it
so i determined to write only formal notes now but to write fully to mr hawkins in secret and also to mina for to her i could write in shorthand which would puzzle the count if he did see it
when i had written my two letters i sat quiet reading a book whilst the count wrote several notes referring as he wrote them to some books on his table
then he took up my two and placed them with his own and put by his writing materials after which the instant the door had closed behind him i leaned over and looked at the letters which were face down on the table
i felt no compunction in doing so for under the circumstances i felt that i should protect myself in every way i could
one of the letters was directed to samuel f
billington no
7 the crescent whitby another to herr leutner varna the third was to coutts & co
london and the fourth to herren klopstock & billreuth bankers budapesth
the second and fourth were unsealed
i was just about to look at them when i saw the doorhandle move
i sank back in my seat having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and to resume my book before the count holding still another letter in his hand entered the room
he took up the letters on the table and stamped them carefully and then turning to me said i trust you will forgive me but i have much work to do in private this evening
you will i hope find all things as you wish
at the door he turned and after a moments pause said let me advise you my dear young friendnay let me warn you with all seriousness that should you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle
it is old and has many memories and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely
be warned
should sleep now or ever overcome you or be like to do then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms for your rest will then be safe
but if you be not careful in this respect thenhe finished his speech in a gruesome way for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing them
i quite understood my only doubt was as to whether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural horrible net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me
later
i endorse the last words written but this time there is no doubt in question
i shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is not
i have placed the crucifix over the head of my bedi imagine that my rest is thus freer from dreams and there it shall remain
when he left me i went to my room
after a little while not hearing any sound i came out and went up the stone stair to where i could look out towards the south
there was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse inaccessible though it was to me as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard
looking out on this i felt that i was indeed in prison and i seemed to want a breath of fresh air though it were of the night
i am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me
it is destroying my nerve
i start at my own shadow and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings
god knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place
i looked out over the beautiful expanse bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day
in the soft light the distant hills became melted and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness
the mere beauty seemed to cheer me there was peace and comfort in every breath i drew
as i leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me and somewhat to my left where i imagined from the order of the rooms that the windows of the counts own room would look out
the window at which i stood was tall and deep stonemullioned and though weatherworn was still complete but it was evidently many a day since the case had been there
i drew back behind the stonework and looked carefully out
what i saw was the counts head coming out from the window
i did not see the face but i knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms
in any case i could not mistake the hands which i had had so many opportunities of studying
i was at first interested and somewhat amused for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner
but my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when i saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings
at first i could not believe my eyes
i thought it was some trick of the moonlight some weird effect of shadow but i kept looking and it could be no delusion
i saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed just as a lizard moves along a wall
what manner of man is this or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man
i feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me i am in fearin awful fearand there is no escape for me i am encompassed about with terrors that i dare not think of
15 may
once more have i seen the count go out in his lizard fashion
he moved downwards in a sidelong way some hundred feet down and a good deal to the left
he vanished into some hole or window
when his head had disappeared i leaned out to try and see more but without availthe distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight
i knew he had left the castle now and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than i had dared to do as yet
i went back to the room and taking a lamp tried all the doors
they were all locked as i had expected and the locks were comparatively new but i went down the stone stairs to the hall where i had entered originally
i found i could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains but the door was locked and the key was gone
that key must be in the counts room i must watch should his door be unlocked so that i may get it and escape
i went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages and to try the doors that opened from them
one or two small rooms near the hall were open but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture dusty with age and motheaten
at last however i found one door at the top of the stairway which though it seemed to be locked gave a little under pressure
i tried it harder and found that it was not really locked but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat and the heavy door rested on the floor
here was an opportunity which i might not have again so i exerted myself and with many efforts forced it back so that i could enter
i was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms i knew and a storey lower down
from the windows i could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle the windows of the end room looking out both west and south
on the latter side as well as to the former there was a great precipice
the castle was built on the corner of a great rock so that on three sides it was quite impregnable and great windows were placed here where sling or bow or culverin could not reach and consequently light and comfort impossible to a position which had to be guarded were secured
to the west was a great valley and then rising far away great jagged mountain fastnesses rising peak on peak the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone
this was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days for the furniture had more air of comfort than any i had seen
the windows were curtainless and the yellow moonlight flooding in through the diamond panes enabled one to see even colours whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth
my lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight but i was glad to have it with me for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble
still it was better than living alone in the rooms which i had come to hate from the presence of the count and after trying a little to school my nerves i found a soft quietude come over me
here i am sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen with much thought and many blushes her illspelt loveletter and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since i closed it last
it is nineteenth century uptodate with a vengeance
and yet unless my senses deceive me the old centuries had and have powers of their own which mere modernity cannot kill
later the morning of 16 may
god preserve my sanity for to this i am reduced
safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past
whilst i live on here there is but one thing to hope for that i may not go mad if indeed i be not mad already
if i be sane then surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the count is the least dreadful to me that to him alone i can look for safety even though this be only whilst i can serve his purpose
great god
merciful god
let me be calm for out of that way lies madness indeed
i begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me
up to now i never quite knew what shakespeare meant when he made hamlet say my tablets
quick my tablets
tis meet that i put it down etc
for now feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which must end in its undoing i turn to my diary for repose
the habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me
the counts mysterious warning frightened me at the time it frightens me more now when i think of it for in future he has a fearful hold upon me
i shall fear to doubt what he may say
when i had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket i felt sleepy
the counts warning came into my mind but i took a pleasure in disobeying it
the sense of sleep was upon me and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider
the soft moonlight soothed and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me
i determined not to return tonight to the gloomhaunted rooms but to sleep here where of old ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars
i drew a great couch out of its place near the corner so that as i lay i could look at the lovely view to east and south and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust composed myself for sleep
i suppose i must have fallen asleep i hope so but i fear for all that followed was startlingly realso real that now sitting here in the broad full sunlight of the morning i cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep
i was not alone
the room was the same unchanged in any way since i came into it i could see along the floor in the brilliant moonlight my own footsteps marked where i had disturbed the long accumulation of dust
in the moonlight opposite me were three young women ladies by their dress and manner
i thought at the time that i must be dreaming when i saw them for though the moonlight was behind them they threw no shadow on the floor
they came close to me and looked at me for some time and then whispered together
two were dark and had high aquiline noses like the count and great dark piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon
the other was fair as fair as can be with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires
i seemed somehow to know her face and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear but i could not recollect at the moment how or where
all three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips
there was something about them that made me uneasy some longing and at the same time some deadly fear
i felt in my heart a wicked burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips
it is not good to note this down lest some day it should meet minas eyes and cause her pain but it is the truth
they whispered together and then they all three laughedsuch a silvery musical laugh but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips
it was like the intolerable tingling sweetness of waterglasses when played on by a cunning hand
the fair girl shook her head coquettishly and the other two urged her on
one said go on
you are first and we shall follow yours is the right to begin
the other added he is young and strong there are kisses for us all
i lay quiet looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation
the fair girl advanced and bent over me till i could feel the movement of her breath upon me
sweet it was in one sense honeysweet and sent the same tingling through the nerves as her voice but with a bitter underlying the sweet a bitter offensiveness as one smells in blood
i was afraid to raise my eyelids but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes
the girl went on her knees and bent over me simply gloating
there was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal till i could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth
lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat
then she paused and i could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips and could feel the hot breath on my neck
then the skin of my throat began to tingle as ones flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearernearer
i could feel the soft shivering touch of the lips on the supersensitive skin of my throat and the hard dents of two sharp teeth just touching and pausing there
i closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waitedwaited with beating heart
but at that instant another sensation swept through me as quick as lightning
i was conscious of the presence of the count and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury
as my eyes opened involuntarily i saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giants power draw it back the blue eyes transformed with fury the white teeth champing with rage and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion
but the count
never did i imagine such wrath and fury even to the demons of the pit
his eyes were positively blazing
the red light in them was lurid as if the flames of hellfire blazed behind them
his face was deathly pale and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of whitehot metal
with a fierce sweep of his arm he hurled the woman from him and then motioned to the others as though he were beating them back it was the same imperious gesture that i had seen used to the wolves
in a voice which though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room he said how dare you touch him any of you
how dare you cast eyes on him when i had forbidden it
back i tell you all
this man belongs to me
beware how you meddle with him or youll have to deal with me
the fair girl with a laugh of ribald coquetry turned to answer him you yourself never loved you never love
on this the other women joined and such a mirthless hard soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear it seemed like the pleasure of fiends
then the count turned after looking at my face attentively and said in a soft whisper yes i too can love you yourselves can tell it from the past
well now i promise you that when i am done with him you shall kiss him at your will
now go
go
i must awaken him for there is work to be done
are we to have nothing tonight
said one of them with a low laugh as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor and which moved as though there were some living thing within it
for answer he nodded his head
one of the women jumped forward and opened it
if my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail as of a halfsmothered child
the women closed round whilst i was aghast with horror but as i looked they disappeared and with them the dreadful bag
there was no door near them and they could not have passed me without my noticing
they simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window for i could see outside the dim shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away
then the horror overcame me and i sank down unconscious
i awoke in my own bed
if it be that i had not dreamt the count must have carried me here
i tried to satisfy myself on the subject but could not arrive at any unquestionable result
to be sure there were certain small evidences such as that my clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit
my watch was still unwound and i am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed and many such details
but these things are no proof for they may have been evidences that my mind was not as usual and from some cause or another i had certainly been much upset
i must watch for proof
of one thing i am glad if it was that the count carried me here and undressed me he must have been hurried in his task for my pockets are intact
i am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not have brooked
he would have taken or destroyed it
as i look round this room although it has been to me so full of fear it is now a sort of sanctuary for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women who werewho are waiting to suck my blood
18 may
i have been down to look at that room again in daylight for i must know the truth
when i got to the doorway at the top of the stairs i found it closed
it had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered
i could see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot but the door is fastened from the inside
i fear it was no dream and must act on this surmise
19 may
i am surely in the toils
last night the count asked me in the suavest tones to write three letters one saying that my work here was nearly done and that i should start for home within a few days another that i was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter and the third that i had left the castle and arrived at bistritz
i would fain have rebelled but felt that in the present state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the count whilst i am so absolutely in his power and to refuse would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger
he knows that i know too much and that i must not live lest i be dangerous to him my only chance is to prolong my opportunities
something may occur which will give me a chance to escape
i saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him
he explained to me that posts were few and uncertain and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends and he assured me with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters which would be held over at bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay that to oppose him would have been to create new suspicion
i therefore pretended to fall in with his views and asked him what dates i should put on the letters
he calculated a minute and then said the first should be june 12 the second june 19 and the third june 29
i know now the span of my life
god help me
28 may
there is a chance of escape or at any rate of being able to send word home
a band of szgany have come to the castle and are encamped in the courtyard
these szgany are gipsies i have notes of them in my book
they are peculiar to this part of the world though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over
there are thousands of them in hungary and transylvania who are almost outside all law
they attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or boyar and call themselves by his name
they are fearless and without religion save superstition and they talk only their own varieties of the romany tongue
i shall write some letters home and shall try to get them to have them posted
i have already spoken them through my window to begin acquaintanceship
they took their hats off and made obeisance and many signs which however i could not understand any more than i could their spoken language
i have written the letters
minas is in shorthand and i simply ask mr hawkins to communicate with her
to her i have explained my situation but without the horrors which i may only surmise
it would shock and frighten her to death were i to expose my heart to her
should the letters not carry then the count shall not yet know my secret or the extent of my knowledge
i have given the letters i threw them through the bars of my window with a gold piece and made what signs i could to have them posted
the man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed and then put them in his cap
i could do no more
i stole back to the study and began to read
as the count did not come in i have written here
the count has come
he sat down beside me and said in his smoothest voice as he opened two letters the szgany has given me these of which though i know not whence they come i shall of course take care
see
he must have looked at itone is from you and to my friend peter hawkins the otherhere he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope and the dark look came into his face and his eyes blazed wickedlythe other is a vile thing an outrage upon friendship and hospitality
it is not signed
so it cannot matter to us
and he calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed
then he went on the letter to hawkinsthat i shall of course send on since it is yours
your letters are sacred to me
your pardon my friend that unknowingly i did break the seal
will you not cover it again
he held out the letter to me and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope
i could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence
when he went out of the room i could hear the key turn softly
a minute later i went over and tried it and the door was locked
when an hour or two after the count came quietly into the room his coming awakened me for i had gone to sleep on the sofa
he was very courteous and very cheery in his manner and seeing that i had been sleeping he said so my friend you are tired
get to bed
there is the surest rest
i may not have the pleasure to talk tonight since there are many labours to me but you will sleep i pray
i passed to my room and went to bed and strange to say slept without dreaming
despair has its own calms
31 may
this morning when i woke i thought i would provide myself with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket so that i might write in case i should get an opportunity but again a surprise again a shock
every scrap of paper was gone and with it all my notes my memoranda relating to railways and travel my letter of credit in fact all that might be useful to me were i once outside the castle
i sat and pondered awhile and then some thought occurred to me and i made search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where i had placed my clothes
the suit in which i had travelled was gone and also my overcoat and rug i could find no trace of them anywhere
this looked like some new scheme of villainy
17 june
this morning as i was sitting on the edge of my bed cudgelling my brains i heard without a cracking of whips and pounding and scraping of horses feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard
with joy i hurried to the window and saw drive into the yard two great leiterwagons each drawn by eight sturdy horses and at the head of each pair a slovak with his wide hat great nailstudded belt dirty sheepskin and high boots
they had also their long staves in hand
i ran to the door intending to descend and try and join them through the main hall as i thought that way might be opened for them
again a shock my door was fastened on the outside
then i ran to the window and cried to them
they looked up at me stupidly and pointed but just then the hetman of the szgany came out and seeing them pointing to my window said something at which they laughed
henceforth no effort of mine no piteous cry or agonised entreaty would make them even look at me
they resolutely turned away
the leiterwagons contained great square boxes with handles of thick rope these were evidently empty by the ease with which the slovaks handled them and by their resonance as they were roughly moved
when they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the yard the slovaks were given some money by the szgany and spitting on it for luck lazily went each to his horses head
shortly afterwards i heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance
24 june before morning
last night the count left me early and locked himself into his own room
as soon as i dared i ran up the winding stair and looked out of the window which opened south
i thought i would watch for the count for there is something going on
the szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind
i know it for now and then i hear a faraway muffled sound as of mattock and spade and whatever it is it must be the end of some ruthless villainy
i had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour when i saw something coming out of the counts window
i drew back and watched carefully and saw the whole man emerge
it was a new shock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes which i had worn whilst travelling here and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which i had seen the women take away
there could be no doubt as to his quest and in my garb too
this then is his new scheme of evil that he will allow others to see me as they think so that he may both leave evidence that i have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own letters and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local people be attributed to me
it makes me rage to think that this can go on and whilst i am shut up here a veritable prisoner but without that protection of the law which is even a criminals right and consolation
i thought i would watch for the counts return and for a long time sat doggedly at the window
then i began to notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight
they were like the tiniest grains of dust and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way
i watched them with a sense of soothing and a sort of calm stole over me
i leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position so that i could enjoy more fully the arial gambolling
something made me start up a low piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley which was hidden from my sight
louder it seemed to ring in my ears and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight
i felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts nay my very soul was struggling and my halfremembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call
i was becoming hypnotised
quicker and quicker danced the dust the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond
more and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes
and then i started broad awake and in full possession of my senses and ran screaming from the place
the phantom shapes which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams were those of the three ghostly women to whom i was doomed
i fled and felt somewhat safer in my own room where there was no moonlight and where the lamp was burning brightly
when a couple of hours had passed i heard something stirring in the counts room something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed and then there was silence deep awful silence which chilled me
with a beating heart i tried the door but i was locked in my prison and could do nothing
i sat down and simply cried
as i sat i heard a sound in the courtyard withoutthe agonised cry of a woman
i rushed to the window and throwing it up peered out between the bars
there indeed was a woman with dishevelled hair holding her hands over her heart as one distressed with running
she was leaning against a corner of the gateway
when she saw my face at the window she threw herself forward and shouted in a voice laden with menace monster give me my child
she threw herself on her knees and raising up her hands cried the same words in tones which wrung my heart
then she tore her hair and beat her breast and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant emotion
finally she threw herself forward and though i could not see her i could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door
somewhere high overhead probably on the tower i heard the voice of the count calling in his harsh metallic whisper
his call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves
before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured like a pentup dam when liberated through the wide entrance into the courtyard
there was no cry from the woman and the howling of the wolves was but short
before long they streamed away singly licking their lips
i could not pity her for i knew now what had become of her child and she was better dead
what shall i do
what can i do
how can i escape from this dreadful thing of night and gloom and fear
25 june morning
no man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be
when the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there
my fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth
i must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me
last night one of my postdated letters went to post the first of that fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth
let me not think of it
action
it has always been at nighttime that i have been molested or threatened or in some way in danger or in fear
i have not yet seen the count in the daylight
can it be that he sleeps when others wake that he may be awake whilst they sleep
if i could only get into his room
but there is no possible way
the door is always locked no way for me
yes there is a way if one dares to take it
where his body has gone why may not another body go
i have seen him myself crawl from his window
why should not i imitate him and go in by his window
the chances are desperate but my need is more desperate still
i shall risk it
at the worst it can only be death and a mans death is not a calfs and the dreaded hereafter may still be open to me
god help me in my task
goodbye mina if i fail goodbye my faithful friend and second father goodbye all and last of all mina
same day later
i have made the effort and god helping me have come safely back to this room
i must put down every detail in order
i went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around the building on this side
the stones are big and roughly cut and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them
i took off my boots and ventured out on the desperate way
i looked down once so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me but after that kept my eyes away from it
i knew pretty well the direction and distance of the counts window and made for it as well as i could having regard to the opportunities available
i did not feel dizzyi suppose i was too excitedand the time seemed ridiculously short till i found myself standing on the windowsill and trying to raise up the sash
i was filled with agitation however when i bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window
then i looked around for the count but with surprise and gladness made a discovery
the room was empty
it was barely furnished with odd things which seemed to have never been used the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms and was covered with dust
i looked for the key but it was not in the lock and i could not find it anywhere
the only thing i found was a great heap of gold in one cornergold of all kinds roman and british and austrian and hungarian and greek and turkish money covered with a film of dust as though it had lain long in the ground
none of it that i noticed was less than three hundred years old
there were also chains and ornaments some jewelled but all of them old and stained
at one corner of the room was a heavy door
i tried it for since i could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door which was the main object of my search i must make further examination or all my efforts would be in vain
it was open and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway which went steeply down
i descended minding carefully where i went for the stairs were dark being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry
at the bottom there was a dark tunnellike passage through which came a deathly sickly odour the odour of old earth newly turned
as i went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier
at last i pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar and found myself in an old ruined chapel which had evidently been used as a graveyard
the roof was broken and in two places were steps leading to vaults but the ground had recently been dug over and the earth placed in great wooden boxes manifestly those which had been brought by the slovaks
there was nobody about and i made search for any further outlet but there was none
then i went over every inch of the ground so as not to lose a chance
i went down even into the vaults where the dim light struggled although to do so was a dread to my very soul
into two of these i went but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust in the third however i made a discovery
there in one of the great boxes of which there were fifty in all on a pile of newly dug earth lay the count
he was either dead or asleep i could not say whichfor the eyes were open and stony but without the glassiness of deathand the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor the lips were as red as ever
but there was no sign of movement no pulse no breath no beating of the heart
i bent over him and tried to find any sign of life but in vain
he could not have lain there long for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours
by the side of the box was its cover pierced with holes here and there
i thought he might have the keys on him but when i went to search i saw the dead eyes and in them dead though they were such a look of hate though unconscious of me or my presence that i fled from the place and leaving the counts room by the window crawled again up the castle wall
regaining my room i threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think
29 june
today is the date of my last letter and the count has taken steps to prove that it was genuine for again i saw him leave the castle by the same window and in my clothes
as he went down the wall lizard fashion i wished i had a gun or some lethal weapon that i might destroy him but i fear that no weapon wrought alone by mans hand would have any effect on him
i dared not wait to see him return for i feared to see those weird sisters
i came back to the library and read there till i fell asleep
i was awakened by the count who looked at me as grimly as a man can look as he said tomorrow my friend we must part
you return to your beautiful england i to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet
your letter home has been despatched tomorrow i shall not be here but all shall be ready for your journey
in the morning come the szgany who have some labours of their own here and also come some slovaks
when they have gone my carriage shall come for you and shall bear you to the borgo pass to meet the diligence from bukovina to bistritz
but i am in hopes that i shall see more of you at castle dracula
i suspected him and determined to test his sincerity
sincerity
it seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster so asked him pointblank why may i not go tonight
because dear sir my coachman and horses are away on a mission
but i would walk with pleasure
i want to get away at once
he smiled such a soft smooth diabolical smile that i knew there was some trick behind his smoothness
he said and your baggage
i do not care about it
i can send for it some other time
the count stood up and said with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my eyes it seemed so real you english have a saying which is close to my heart for its spirit is that which rules our boyars welcome the coming speed the parting guest
come with me my dear young friend
not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will though sad am i at your going and that you so suddenly desire it
with a stately gravity he with the lamp preceded me down the stairs and along the hall
suddenly he stopped
hark
close at hand came the howling of many wolves
it was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the bton of the conductor
after a pause of a moment he proceeded in his stately way to the door drew back the ponderous bolts unhooked the heavy chains and began to draw it open
to my intense astonishment i saw that it was unlocked
suspiciously i looked all round but could see no key of any kind
as the door began to open the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier their red jaws with champing teeth and their bluntclawed feet as they leaped came in through the opening door
i knew then that to struggle at the moment against the count was useless
with such allies as these at his command i could do nothing
but still the door continued slowly to open and only the counts body stood in the gap
suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my doom i was to be given to the wolves and at my own instigation
there was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the count and as a last chance i cried out shut the door i shall wait till morning
and covered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment
with one sweep of his powerful arm the count threw the door shut and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places
in silence we returned to the library and after a minute or two i went to my own room
the last i saw of count dracula was his kissing his hand to me with a red light of triumph in his eyes and with a smile that judas in hell might be proud of
when i was in my room and about to lie down i thought i heard a whispering at my door
i went to it softly and listened
unless my ears deceived me i heard the voice of the count back back to your own place
your time is not yet come
wait
have patience
tonight is mine
tomorrow night is yours
there was a low sweet ripple of laughter and in a rage i threw open the door and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips
as i appeared they all joined in a horrible laugh and ran away
i came back to my room and threw myself on my knees
it is then so near the end
tomorrow
lord help me and those to whom i am dear
30 june morning
these may be the last words i ever write in this diary
i slept till just before the dawn and when i woke threw myself on my knees for i determined that if death came he should find me ready
at last i felt that subtle change in the air and knew that the morning had come
then came the welcome cockcrow and i felt that i was safe
with a glad heart i opened my door and ran down to the hall
i had seen that the door was unlocked and now escape was before me
with hands that trembled with eagerness i unhooked the chains and drew back the massive bolts
but the door would not move
despair seized me
i pulled and pulled at the door and shook it till massive as it was it rattled in its casement
i could see the bolt shot
it had been locked after i left the count
then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk and i determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the counts room
he might kill me but death now seemed the happier choice of evils
without a pause i rushed up to the east window and scrambled down the wall as before into the counts room
it was empty but that was as i expected
i could not see a key anywhere but the heap of gold remained
i went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel
i knew now well enough where to find the monster i sought
the great box was in the same place close against the wall but the lid was laid on it not fastened down but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home
i knew i must reach the body for the key so i raised the lid and laid it back against the wall and then i saw something which filled my very soul with horror
there lay the count but looking as if his youth had been half renewed for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark irongrey the cheeks were fuller and the white skin seemed rubyred underneath the mouth was redder than ever for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck
even the deep burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated
it seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood
he lay like a filthy leech exhausted with his repletion
i shuddered as i bent over to touch him and every sense in me revolted at the contact but i had to search or i was lost
the coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three
i felt all over the body but no sign could i find of the key
then i stopped and looked at the count
there was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad
this was the being i was helping to transfer to london where perhaps for centuries to come he might amongst its teeming millions satiate his lust for blood and create a new and everwidening circle of semidemons to batten on the helpless
the very thought drove me mad
a terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster
there was no lethal weapon at hand but i seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases and lifting it high struck with the edge downward at the hateful face
but as i did so the head turned and the eyes fell full upon me with all their blaze of basilisk horror
the sight seemed to paralyse me and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face merely making a deep gash above the forehead
the shovel fell from my hand across the box and as i pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again and hid the horrid thing from my sight
the last glimpse i had was of the bloated face bloodstained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell
i thought and thought what should be my next move but my brain seemed on fire and i waited with a despairing feeling growing over me
as i waited i heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips the szgany and the slovaks of whom the count had spoken were coming
with a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body i ran from the place and gained the counts room determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened
with strained ears i listened and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door
there must have been some other means of entry or some one had a key for one of the locked doors
then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo
i turned to run down again towards the vault where i might find the new entrance but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying
when i ran to push it open i found that it was hopelessly fast
i was again a prisoner and the net of doom was closing round me more closely
as i write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily doubtless the boxes with their freight of earth
there is a sound of hammering it is the box being nailed down
now i can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall with many other idle feet coming behind them
the door is shut and the chains rattle there is a grinding of the key in the lock i can hear the key withdraw then another door opens and shuts i hear the creaking of lock and bolt
in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels the crack of whips and the chorus of the szgany as they pass into the distance
i am alone in the castle with those awful women
faugh
mina is a woman and there is nought in common
they are devils of the pit
i shall not remain alone with them i shall try to scale the castle wall farther than i have yet attempted
i shall take some of the gold with me lest i want it later
i may find a way from this dreadful place
and then away for home
away to the quickest and nearest train
away from this cursed spot from this cursed land where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet
at least gods mercy is better than that of these monsters and the precipice is steep and high
at its foot a man may sleepas a man
goodbye all
mina
my dearest lucy forgive my long delay in writing but i have been simply overwhelmed with work
the life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying
i am longing to be with you and by the sea where we can talk together freely and build our castles in the air
i have been working very hard lately because i want to keep up with jonathans studies and i have been practising shorthand very assiduously
when we are married i shall be able to be useful to jonathan and if i can stenograph well enough i can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter at which also i am practising very hard
he and i sometimes write letters in shorthand and he is keeping a stenographic journal of his travels abroad
when i am with you i shall keep a diary in the same way
i dont mean one of those twopagestotheweekwithsundaysqueezedinacorner diaries but a sort of journal which i can write in whenever i feel inclined
i do not suppose there will be much of interest to other people but it is not intended for them
i may show it to jonathan some day if there is in it anything worth sharing but it is really an exercise book
i shall try to do what i see lady journalists do interviewing and writing descriptions and trying to remember conversations
i am told that with a little practice one can remember all that goes on or that one hears said during a day
however we shall see
i will tell you of my little plans when we meet
i have just had a few hurried lines from jonathan from transylvania
he is well and will be returning in about a week
i am longing to hear all his news
it must be so nice to see strange countries
i wonder if wei mean jonathan and ishall ever see them together
there is the ten oclock bell ringing
goodbye
your loving mina
tell me all the news when you write
you have not told me anything for a long time
i hear rumours and especially of a tall handsome curlyhaired man
letter lucy westenra to mina murray
17 chatham street wednesday
my dearest mina i must say you tax me very unfairly with being a bad correspondent
i wrote to you twice since we parted and your last letter was only your second
besides i have nothing to tell you
there is really nothing to interest you
town is very pleasant just now and we go a good deal to picturegalleries and for walks and rides in the park
as to the tall curlyhaired man i suppose it was the one who was with me at the last pop
some one has evidently been telling tales
that was mr holmwood
he often comes to see us and he and mamma get on very well together they have so many things to talk about in common
we met some time ago a man that would just do for you if you were not already engaged to jonathan
he is an excellent parti being handsome well off and of good birth
he is a doctor and really clever
just fancy
he is only nineandtwenty and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his own care
mr holmwood introduced him to me and he called here to see us and often comes now
i think he is one of the most resolute men i ever saw and yet the most calm
he seems absolutely imperturbable
i can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients
he has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face as if trying to read ones thoughts
he tries this on very much with me but i flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack
i know that from my glass
do you ever try to read your own face
i do and i can tell you it is not a bad study and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you have never tried it
he says that i afford him a curious psychological study and i humbly think i do
i do not as you know take sufficient interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions
dress is a bore
that is slang again but never mind arthur says that every day
there it is all out
mina we have told all our secrets to each other since we were children we have slept together and eaten together and laughed and cried together and now though i have spoken i would like to speak more
oh mina couldnt you guess
i love him
i am blushing as i write for although i think he loves me he has not told me so in words
but oh mina i love him i love him i love him
there that does me good
i wish i were with you dear sitting by the fire undressing as we used to sit and i would try to tell you what i feel
i do not know how i am writing this even to you
i am afraid to stop or i should tear up the letter and i dont want to stop for i do so want to tell you all
let me hear from you at once and tell me all that you think about it
mina i must stop
bless me in your prayers and mina pray for my happiness
lucy
p
s
i need not tell you this is a secret
goodnight again
l
24 may
my dearest mina thanks and thanks and thanks again for your sweet letter
it was so nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy
my dear it never rains but it pours
how true the old proverbs are
here am i who shall be twenty in september and yet i never had a proposal till today not a real proposal and today i have had three
three proposals in one day
isnt it awful
i feel sorry really and truly sorry for two of the poor fellows
oh mina i am so happy that i dont know what to do with myself
and three proposals
but for goodness sake dont tell any of the girls or they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at least
some girls are so vain
you and i mina dear who are engaged and are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women can despise vanity
well i must tell you about the three but you must keep it a secret dear from every one except of course jonathan
you will tell him because i would if i were in your place certainly tell arthur
a woman ought to tell her husband everythingdont you think so dear
and i must be fair
men like women certainly their wives to be quite as fair as they are and women i am afraid are not always quite as fair as they should be
well my dear number one came just before lunch
i told you of him dr john seward the lunaticasylum man with the strong jaw and the good forehead
he was very cool outwardly but was nervous all the same
he had evidently been schooling himself as to all sorts of little things and remembered them but he almost managed to sit down on his silk hat which men dont generally do when they are cool and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream
he spoke to me mina very straightforwardly
he told me how dear i was to him though he had known me so little and what his life would be with me to help and cheer him
he was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if i did not care for him but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute and would not add to my present trouble
then he broke off and asked if i could love him in time and when i shook my head his hands trembled and then with some hesitation he asked me if i cared already for any one else
he put it very nicely saying that he did not want to wring my confidence from me but only to know because if a womans heart was free a man might have hope
and then mina i felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one
i only told him that much and then he stood up and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped i would be happy and that if i ever wanted a friend i must count him one of my best
oh mina dear i cant help crying and you must excuse this letter being all blotted
being proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing but it isnt at all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow whom you know loves you honestly going away and looking all brokenhearted and to know that no matter what he may say at the moment you are passing quite out of his life
my dear i must stop here at present i feel so miserable though i am so happy
evening
arthur has just gone and i feel in better spirits than when i left off so i can go on telling you about the day
well my dear number two came after lunch
he is such a nice fellow an american from texas and he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he has been to so many places and has had such adventures
i sympathise with poor desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her ear even by a black man
i suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears and we marry him
i know now what i would do if i were a man and wanted to make a girl love me
no i dont for there was mr morris telling us his stories and arthur never told any and yet my dear i am somewhat previous
mr quincey p
morris found me alone
it seems that a man always does find a girl alone
no he doesnt for arthur tried twice to make a chance and i helping him all i could i am not ashamed to say it now
i must tell you beforehand that mr morris doesnt always speak slangthat is to say he never does so to strangers or before them for he is really well educated and has exquisite mannersbut he found out that it amused me to hear him talk american slang and whenever i was present and there was no one to be shocked he said such funny things
i am afraid my dear he has to invent it all for it fits exactly into whatever else he has to say
but this is a way slang has
i do not know myself if i shall ever speak slang i do not know if arthur likes it as i have never heard him use any as yet
well mr morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly as he could but i could see all the same that he was very nervous
he took my hand in his and said ever so sweetly miss lucy i know i aint good enough to regulate the fixins of your little shoes but i guess if you wait till you find a man that is you will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit
wont you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road together driving in double harness
well he did look so goodhumoured and so jolly that it didnt seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poor dr seward so i said as lightly as i could that i did not know anything of hitching and that i wasnt broken to harness at all yet
then he said that he had spoken in a light manner and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so on so grave so momentous an occasion for him i would forgive him
he really did look serious when he was saying it and i couldnt help feeling a bit serious tooi know mina you will think me a horrid flirtthough i couldnt help feeling a sort of exultation that he was number two in one day
and then my dear before i could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of lovemaking laying his very heart and soul at my feet
he looked so earnest over it that i shall never again think that a man must be playful always and never earnest because he is merry at times
i suppose he saw something in my face which checked him for he suddenly stopped and said with a sort of manly fervour that i could have loved him for if i had been free lucy you are an honesthearted girl i know
i should not be here speaking to you as i am now if i did not believe you clean grit right through to the very depths of your soul
tell me like one good fellow to another is there any one else that you care for
and if there is ill never trouble you a hairs breadth again but will be if you will let me a very faithful friend
my dear mina why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy of them
here was i almost making fun of this greathearted true gentleman
i burst into tearsi am afraid my dear you will think this a very sloppy letter in more ways than oneand i really felt very badly
why cant they let a girl marry three men or as many as want her and save all this trouble
but this is heresy and i must not say it
i am glad to say that though i was crying i was able to look into mr morriss brave eyes and i told him out straight yes there is some one i love though he has not told me yet that he even loves me
i was right to speak to him so frankly for quite a light came into his face and he put out both his hands and took minei think i put them into hisand said in a hearty way thats my brave girl
its better worth being late for a chance of winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world
dont cry my dear
if its for me im a hard nut to crack and i take it standing up
if that other fellow doesnt know his happiness well hed better look for it soon or hell have to deal with me
little girl your honesty and pluck have made me a friend and thats rarer than a lover its more unselfish anyhow
my dear im going to have a pretty lonely walk between this and kingdom come
wont you give me one kiss
itll be something to keep off the darkness now and then
you can you know if you like for that other good fellowhe must be a good fellow my dear and a fine fellow or you could not love himhasnt spoken yet
that quite won me mina for it was brave and sweet of him and noble too to a rivalwasnt it
and he so sad so i leant over and kissed him
he stood up with my two hands in his and as he looked down into my facei am afraid i was blushing very muchhe said little girl i hold your hand and youve kissed me and if these things dont make us friends nothing ever will
thank you for your sweet honesty to me and goodbye
he wrung my hand and taking up his hat went straight out of the room without looking back without a tear or a quiver or a pause and i am crying like a baby
oh why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would worship the very ground he trod on
i know i would if i were freeonly i dont want to be free
my dear this quite upset me and i feel i cannot write of happiness just at once after telling you of it and i dont wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy
ever your loving lucy
oh about number threei neednt tell you of number three need i
besides it was all so confused it seemed only a moment from his coming into the room till both his arms were round me and he was kissing me
i am very very happy and i dont know what i have done to deserve it
i must only try in the future to show that i am not ungrateful to god for all his goodness to me in sending to me such a lover such a husband and such a friend

kept in phonograph 25 may
ebb tide in appetite today
cannot eat cannot rest so diary instead
since my rebuff of yesterday i have a sort of empty feeling nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth the doing
as i knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was work i went down amongst the patients
i picked out one who has afforded me a study of much interest
he is so quaint that i am determined to understand him as well as i can
today i seemed to get nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery
i questioned him more fully than i had ever done with a view to making myself master of the facts of his hallucination
in my manner of doing it there was i now see something of cruelty
i seemed to wish to keep him to the point of his madnessa thing which i avoid with the patients as i would the mouth of hell
under what circumstances would i not avoid the pit of hell
omnia rom venalia sunt
hell has its price

if there be anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards accurately so i had better commence to do so therefore r

sanguine temperament great physical strength morbidly excitable periods of gloom ending in some fixed idea which i cannot make out
i presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the disturbing influence end in a mentallyaccomplished finish a possibly dangerous man probably dangerous if unselfish
in selfish men caution is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves
what i think of on this point is when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is balanced with the centrifugal when duty a cause etc
is the fixed point the latter force is paramount and only accident or a series of accidents can balance it

whitby
lucy met me at the station looking sweeter and lovelier than ever and we drove up to the house at the crescent in which they have rooms
this is a lovely place
the little river the esk runs through a deep valley which broadens out as it comes near the harbour
a great viaduct runs across with high piers through which the view seems somehow further away than it really is
the valley is beautifully green and it is so steep that when you are on the high land on either side you look right across it unless you are near enough to see down
the houses of the old townthe side away from usare all redroofed and seem piled up one over the other anyhow like the pictures we see of nuremberg
right over the town is the ruin of whitby abbey which was sacked by the danes and which is the scene of part of marmion where the girl was built up in the wall
it is a most noble ruin of immense size and full of beautiful and romantic bits there is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows
between it and the town there is another church the parish one round which is a big graveyard all full of tombstones
this is to my mind the nicest spot in whitby for it lies right over the town and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called kettleness stretches out into the sea
it descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away and some of the graves have been destroyed
in one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below
there are walks with seats beside them through the churchyard and people go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze
i shall come and sit here very often myself and work
indeed i am writing now with my book on my knee and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me
they seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and talk
the harbour lies below me with on the far side one long granite wall stretching out into the sea with a curve outwards at the end of it in the middle of which is a lighthouse
a heavy seawall runs along outside of it
on the near side the seawall makes an elbow crooked inversely and its end too has a lighthouse
between the two piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour which then suddenly widens
it is nice at high water but when the tide is out it shoals away to nothing and there is merely the stream of the esk running between banks of sand with rocks here and there
outside the harbour on this side there rises for about half a mile a great reef the sharp edge of which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse
at the end of it is a buoy with a bell which swings in bad weather and sends in a mournful sound on the wind
they have a legend here that when a ship is lost bells are heard out at sea
i must ask the old man about this he is coming this way
he is a funny old man
he must be awfully old for his face is all gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree
he tells me that he is nearly a hundred and that he was a sailor in the greenland fishing fleet when waterloo was fought
he is i am afraid a very sceptical person for when i asked him about the bells at sea and the white lady at the abbey he said very brusquely i wouldnt fash masel about them miss
them things be all wore out
mind i dont say that they never was but i do say that they wasnt in my time
they be all very well for comers and trippers an the like but not for a nice young lady like you
them feetfolks from york and leeds that be always eatin cured herrins an drinkin tea an lookin out to buy cheap jet would creed aught
i wonder masel whod be bothered tellin lies to themeven the newspapers which is full of fooltalk
i thought he would be a good person to learn interesting things from so i asked him if he would mind telling me something about the whalefishing in the old days
he was just settling himself to begin when the clock struck six whereupon he laboured to get up and said i must gang ageeanwards home now miss
my granddaughter doesnt like to be kept waitin when the tea is ready for it takes me time to crammle aboon the grees for there be a many of em an miss i lack bellytimber sairly by the clock
he hobbled away and i could see him hurrying as well as he could down the steps
the steps are a great feature on the place
they lead from the town up to the church there are hundreds of themi do not know how manyand they wind up in a delicate curve the slope is so gentle that a horse could easily walk up and down them
i think they must originally have had something to do with the abbey
i shall go home too
lucy went out visiting with her mother and as they were only duty calls i did not go
they will be home by this
1 august
i came up here an hour ago with lucy and we had a most interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come and join him
he is evidently the sir oracle of them and i should think must have been in his time a most dictatorial person
he will not admit anything and downfaces everybody
if he cant outargue them he bullies them and then takes their silence for agreement with his views
lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock she has got a beautiful colour since she has been here
i noticed that the old men did not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down
she is so sweet with old people i think they all fell in love with her on the spot
even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her but gave me double share instead
i got him on the subject of the legends and he went off at once into a sort of sermon
i must try to remember it and put it down it be all fooltalk lock stock and barrel thats what it be an nowt else
these bans an wafts an bohghosts an barguests an bogles an all anent them is only fit to set bairns an dizzy women abelderin
they be nowt but airblebs
they an all grims an signs an warnins be all invented by parsons an illsome beukbodies an railway touters to skeer an scunner hafflins an to get folks to do somethin that they dont other incline to
it makes me ireful to think o them
why its them that not content with printin lies on paper an preachin them out of pulpits does want to be cuttin them on the tombstones
look here all around you in what airt ye will all them steans holdin up their heads as well as they can out of their pride is acantsimply tumblin down with the weight o the lies wrote on them here lies the body or sacred to the memory wrote on all of them an yet in nigh half of them there beant no bodies at all an the memories of them beant cared a pinch of snuff about much less sacred
lies all of them nothin but lies of one kind or another
my gog but itll be a quare scowderment at the day of judgment when they come tumblin up in their deathsarks all jouped together an tryin to drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was some of them trimmlin and ditherin with their hands that dozzened an slippy from lyin in the sea that they cant even keep their grup o them
i could see from the old fellows selfsatisfied air and the way in which he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was showing off so i put in a word to keep him going oh mr swales you cant be serious
surely these tombstones are not all wrong
yabblins
there may be a poorish few not wrong savin where they make out the people too good for there be folk that do think a balmbowl be like the sea if only it be their own
the whole thing be only lies
now look you here you come here a stranger an you see this kirkgarth
i nodded for i thought it better to assent though i did not quite understand his dialect
i knew it had something to do with the church
he went on and you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be happed here snod an snog
i assented again
then that be just where the lie comes in
why there be scores of these laybeds that be toom as old duns baccabox on friday night
he nudged one of his companions and they all laughed
and my gog
how could they be otherwise
look at that one the aftest abaft the bierbank read it
i went over and read edward spencelagh master mariner murdered by pirates off the coast of andres april 1854 t
30
when i came back mr swales went on who brought him home i wonder to hap him here
murdered off the coast of andres
an you consated his body lay under
why i could name ye a dozen whose bones lie in the greenland seas abovehe pointed northwardsor where the currents may have drifted them
there be the steans around ye
ye can with your young eyes read the smallprint of the lies from here
this braithwaite lowreyi knew his father lost in the lively off greenland in 20 or andrew woodhouse drowned in the same seas in 1777 or john paxton drowned off cape farewell a year later or old john rawlings whose grandfather sailed with me drowned in the gulf of finland in 50
do ye think that all these men will have to make a rush to whitby when the trumpet sounds
i have me antherums aboot it
i tell ye that when they got here theyd be jommlin an jostlin one another that way that it ud be like a fight up on the ice in the old days when wed be at one another from daylight to dark an tryin to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis
this was evidently local pleasantry for the old man cackled over it and his cronies joined in with gusto
but i said surely you are not quite correct for you start on the assumption that all the poor people or their spirits will have to take their tombstones with them on the day of judgment
do you think that will be really necessary
well what else be they tombstones for
answer me that miss
to please their relatives i suppose
to please their relatives you suppose
this he said with intense scorn
how will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote over them and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies
he pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab on which the seat was rested close to the edge of the cliff
read the lies on that thruffstean he said
the letters were upside down to me from where i sat but lucy was more opposite to them so she leant over and read sacred to the memory of george canon who died in the hope of a glorious resurrection on july 29 1873 falling from the rocks at kettleness
this tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly beloved son
he was the only son of his mother and she was a widow
really mr swales i dont see anything very funny in that
she spoke her comment very gravely and somewhat severely
ye dont see aught funny
ha
but thats because ye dont gawm the sorrowin mother was a hellcat that hated him because he was acrewkda regular lamiter he wasan he hated her so that he committed suicide in order that she mightnt get an insurance she put on his life
he blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that they had for scarin the crows with
twarnt for crows then for it brought the clegs and the dowps to him
thats the way he fell off the rocks
and as to hopes of a glorious resurrection ive often heard him say masel that he hoped hed go to hell for his mother was so pious that shed be sure to go to heaven an he didnt want to addle where she was
now isnt that stean at any ratehe hammered it with his stick as he spokea pack of lies
and wont it make gabriel keckle when geordie comes pantin up the grees with the tombstean balanced on his hump and asks it to be took as evidence
i did not know what to say but lucy turned the conversation as she said rising up oh why did you tell us of this
it is my favourite seat and i cannot leave it and now i find i must go on sitting over the grave of a suicide
that wont harm ye my pretty an it may make poor geordie gladsome to have so trim a lass sittin on his lap
that wont hurt ye
why ive sat here off an on for nigh twenty years past an it hasnt done me no harm
dont ye fash about them as lies under ye or that doesn lie there either
itll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the tombsteans all run away with and the place as bare as a stubblefield
theres the clock an i must gang
my service to ye ladies
and off he hobbled
lucy and i sat awhile and it was all so beautiful before us that we took hands as we sat and she told me all over again about arthur and their coming marriage
that made me just a little heartsick for i havent heard from jonathan for a whole month
the same day
i came up here alone for i am very sad
there was no letter for me
i hope there cannot be anything the matter with jonathan
the clock has just struck nine
i see the lights scattered all over the town sometimes in rows where the streets are and sometimes singly they run right up the esk and die away in the curve of the valley
to my left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next the abbey
the sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind me and there is a clatter of a donkeys hoofs up the paved road below
the band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time and further along the quay there is a salvation army meeting in a back street
neither of the bands hears the other but up here i hear and see them both
i wonder where jonathan is and if he is thinking of me
i wish he were here
5 june
the case of renfield grows more interesting the more i get to understand the man
he has certain qualities very largely developed selfishness secrecy and purpose
i wish i could get at what is the object of the latter
he seems to have some settled scheme of his own but what it is i do not yet know
his redeeming quality is a love of animals though indeed he has such curious turns in it that i sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel
his pets are of odd sorts
just now his hobby is catching flies
he has at present such a quantity that i have had myself to expostulate
to my astonishment he did not break out into a fury as i expected but took the matter in simple seriousness
he thought for a moment and then said may i have three days
i shall clear them away
of course i said that would do
i must watch him
18 june
he has turned his mind now to spiders and has got several very big fellows in a box
he keeps feeding them with his flies and the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished although he has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his room
1 july
his spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his flies and today i told him that he must get rid of them
he looked very sad at this so i said that he must clear out some of them at all events
he cheerfully acquiesced in this and i gave him the same time as before for reduction
he disgusted me much while with him for when a horrid blowfly bloated with some carrion food buzzed into the room he caught it held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger and thumb and before i knew what he was going to do put it in his mouth and ate it
i scolded him for it but he argued quietly that it was very good and very wholesome that it was life strong life and gave life to him
this gave me an idea or the rudiment of one
i must watch how he gets rid of his spiders
he has evidently some deep problem in his mind for he keeps a little notebook in which he is always jotting down something
whole pages of it are filled with masses of figures generally single numbers added up in batches and then the totals added in batches again as though he were focussing some account as the auditors put it
8 july
there is a method in his madness and the rudimentary idea in my mind is growing
it will be a whole idea soon and then oh unconscious cerebration
you will have to give the wall to your conscious brother
i kept away from my friend for a few days so that i might notice if there were any change
things remain as they were except that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one
he has managed to get a sparrow and has already partially tamed it
his means of taming is simple for already the spiders have diminished
those that do remain however are well fed for he still brings in the flies by tempting them with his food
19 july
we are progressing
my friend has now a whole colony of sparrows and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated
when i came in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favoura very very great favour and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog
i asked him what it was and he said with a sort of rapture in his voice and bearing a kitten a nice little sleek playful kitten that i can play with and teach and feedand feedand feed
i was not unprepared for this request for i had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and vivacity but i did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders so i said i would see about it and asked him if he would not rather have a cat than a kitten
his eagerness betrayed him as he answered oh yes i would like a cat
i only asked for a kitten lest you should refuse me a cat
no one would refuse me a kitten would they
i shook my head and said that at present i feared it would not be possible but that i would see about it
his face fell and i could see a warning of danger in it for there was a sudden fierce sidelong look which meant killing
the man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac
i shall test him with his present craving and see how it will work out then i shall know more
10 pm i have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner brooding
when i came in he threw himself on his knees before me and implored me to let him have a cat that his salvation depended upon it
i was firm however and told him that he could not have it whereupon he went without a word and sat down gnawing his fingers in the corner where i had found him
i shall see him in the morning early
20 july
visited renfield very early before the attendant went his rounds
found him up and humming a tune
he was spreading out his sugar which he had saved in the window and was manifestly beginning his flycatching again and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace
i looked around for his birds and not seeing them asked him where they were
he replied without turning round that they had all flown away
there were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of blood
i said nothing but went and told the keeper to report to me if there were anything odd about him during the day
11 am the attendant has just been to me to say that renfield has been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers
my belief is doctor he said that he has eaten his birds and that he just took and ate them raw
11 pm i gave renfield a strong opiate tonight enough to make even him sleep and took away his pocketbook to look at it
the thought that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete and the theory proved
my homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind
i shall have to invent a new classification for him and call him a zophagous lifeeating maniac what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he can and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way
he gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds
what would have been his later steps
it would almost be worth while to complete the experiment
it might be done if there were only a sufficient cause
men sneered at vivisection and yet look at its results today
why not advance science in its most difficult and vital aspectthe knowledge of the brain
had i even the secret of one such minddid i hold the key to the fancy of even one lunatici might advance my own branch of science to a pitch compared with which burdonsandersons physiology or ferriers brainknowledge would be as nothing
if only there were a sufficient cause
i must not think too much of this or i may be tempted a good cause might turn the scale with me for may not i too be of an exceptional brain congenitally
how well the man reasoned lunatics always do within their own scope
i wonder at how many lives he values a man or if at only one
he has closed the account most accurately and today begun a new record
how many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives
to me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope and that truly i began a new record
so it will be until the great recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to profit or loss
oh lucy lucy i cannot be angry with you nor can i be angry with my friend whose happiness is yours but i must only wait on hopeless and work
work
if i only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend therea good unselfish cause to make me workthat would be indeed happiness
mina murrays journal
26 july
i am anxious and it soothes me to express myself here it is like whispering to ones self and listening at the same time
and there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from writing
i am unhappy about lucy and about jonathan
i had not heard from jonathan for some time and was very concerned but yesterday dear mr hawkins who is always so kind sent me a letter from him
i had written asking him if he had heard and he said the enclosed had just been received
it is only a line dated from castle dracula and says that he is just starting for home
that is not like jonathan i do not understand it and it makes me uneasy
then too lucy although she is so well has lately taken to her old habit of walking in her sleep
her mother has spoken to me about it and we have decided that i am to lock the door of our room every night
mr
westenra has got an idea that sleepwalkers always go out on roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place
poor dear she is naturally anxious about lucy and she tells me that her husband lucys father had the same habit that he would get up in the night and dress himself and go out if he were not stopped
lucy is to be married in the autumn and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is to be arranged
i sympathise with her for i do the same only jonathan and i will start in life in a very simple way and shall have to try to make both ends meet
mr holmwoodhe is the hon
arthur holmwood only son of lord godalmingis coming up here very shortlyas soon as he can leave town for his father is not very well and i think dear lucy is counting the moments till he comes
she wants to take him up to the seat on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of whitby
i daresay it is the waiting which disturbs her she will be all right when he arrives
27 july
no news from jonathan
i am getting quite uneasy about him though why i should i do not know but i do wish that he would write if it were only a single line
lucy walks more than ever and each night i am awakened by her moving about the room
fortunately the weather is so hot that she cannot get cold but still the anxiety and the perpetually being wakened is beginning to tell on me and i am getting nervous and wakeful myself
thank god lucys health keeps up
mr holmwood has been suddenly called to ring to see his father who has been taken seriously ill
lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him but it does not touch her looks she is a trifle stouter and her cheeks are a lovely rosepink
she has lost that anmic look which she had
i pray it will all last
3 august
another week gone and no news from jonathan not even to mr hawkins from whom i have heard
oh i do hope he is not ill
he surely would have written
i look at that last letter of his but somehow it does not satisfy me
it does not read like him and yet it is his writing
there is no mistake of that
lucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week but there is an odd concentration about her which i do not understand even in her sleep she seems to be watching me
she tries the door and finding it locked goes about the room searching for the key
6 august
another three days and no news
this suspense is getting dreadful
if i only knew where to write to or where to go to i should feel easier but no one has heard a word of jonathan since that last letter
i must only pray to god for patience
lucy is more excitable than ever but is otherwise well
last night was very threatening and the fishermen say that we are in for a storm
i must try to watch it and learn the weather signs
today is a grey day and the sun as i write is hidden in thick clouds high over kettleness
everything is greyexcept the green grass which seems like emerald amongst it grey earthy rock grey clouds tinged with the sunburst at the far edge hang over the grey sea into which the sandpoints stretch like grey fingers
the sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar muffled in the seamists drifting inland
the horizon is lost in a grey mist
all is vastness the clouds are piled up like giant rocks and there is a brool over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom
dark figures are on the beach here and there sometimes half shrouded in the mist and seem men like trees walking
the fishingboats are racing for home and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into the harbour bending to the scuppers
here comes old mr swales
he is making straight for me and i can see by the way he lifts his hat that he wants to talk
i have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man
when he sat down beside me he said in a very gentle way i want to say something to you miss
i could see he was not at ease so i took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak fully so he said leaving his hand in mine im afraid my deary that i must have shocked you by all the wicked things ive been sayin about the dead and such like for weeks past but i didnt mean them and i want ye to remember that when im gone
we aud folks that be daffled and with one foot abaft the krokhooal dont altogether like to think of it and we dont want to feel scart of it an thats why ive took to makin light of it so that id cheer up my own heart a bit
but lord love ye miss i aint afraid of dyin not a bit only i dont want to die if i can help it
my time must be nigh at hand now for i be aud and a hundred years is too much for any man to expect and im so nigh it that the aud man is already whettin his scythe
ye see i cant get out o the habit of caffin about it all at once the chafts will wag as they be used to
some day soon the angel of death will sound his trumpet for me
but dont ye dooal an greet my deary
for he saw that i was cryingif he should come this very night id not refuse to answer his call
for life be after all only a waitin for somethin else than what were doin and death be all that we can rightly depend on
but im content for its comin to me my deary and comin quick
it may be comin while we be lookin and wonderin
maybe its in that wind out over the sea thats bringin with it loss and wreck and sore distress and sad hearts
he cried suddenly
theres something in that wind and in the hoast beyont that sounds and looks and tastes and smells like death
its in the air i feel it comin
lord make me answer cheerful when my call comes
he held up his arms devoutly and raised his hat
his mouth moved as though he were praying
after a few minutes silence he got up shook hands with me and blessed me and said goodbye and hobbled off
it all touched me and upset me very much
i was glad when the coastguard came along with his spyglass under his arm
he stopped to talk with me as he always does but all the time kept looking at a strange ship
i cant make her out he said shes a russian by the look of her but shes knocking about in the queerest way
she doesnt know her mind a bit she seems to see the storm coming but cant decide whether to run up north in the open or to put in here
look there again
she is steered mighty strangely for she doesnt mind the hand on the wheel changes about with every puff of wind
well hear more of her before this time tomorrow
one of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been experienced here with results both strange and unique
the weather had been somewhat sultry but not to any degree uncommon in the month of august
saturday evening was as fine as was ever known and the great body of holidaymakers laid out yesterday for visits to mulgrave woods robin hoods bay rig mill runswick staithes and the various trips in the neighbourhood of whitby
the steamers emma and scarborough made trips up and down the coast and there was an unusual amount of tripping both to and from whitby
the day was unusually fine till the afternoon when some of the gossips who frequent the east cliff churchyard and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east called attention to a sudden show of marestails high in the sky to the northwest
the wind was then blowing from the southwest in the mild degree which in barometrical language is ranked no
2 light breeze
the coastguard on duty at once made report and one old fisherman who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the east cliff foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm
the approach of sunset was so very beautiful so grand in its masses of splendidlycoloured clouds that there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty
before the sun dipped below the black mass of kettleness standing boldly athwart the western sky its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunsetcolourflame purple pink green violet and all the tints of gold with here and there masses not large but of seemingly absolute blackness in all sorts of shapes as well outlined as colossal silhouettes
the experience was not lost on the painters and doubtless some of the sketches of the prelude to the great storm will grace the r
a
and r
i
walls in may next
more than one captain made up his mind then and there that his cobble or his mule as they term the different classes of boats would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed
the wind fell away entirely during the evening and at midnight there was a dead calm a sultry heat and that prevailing intensity which on the approach of thunder affects persons of a sensitive nature
there were but few lights in sight at sea for even the coasting steamers which usually hug the shore so closely kept well to seaward and but few fishingboats were in sight
the only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set which was seemingly going westwards
the foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in face of her danger
before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
shortly before ten oclock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard and the band on the pier with its lively french air was like a discord in the great harmony of natures silence
a little after midnight came a strange sound from over the sea and high overhead the air began to carry a strange faint hollow booming
then without warning the tempest broke
with a rapidity which at the time seemed incredible and even afterwards is impossible to realize the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed
the waves rose in growing fury each overtopping its fellow till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster
whitecrested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs others broke over the piers and with their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier of whitby harbour
the wind roared like thunder and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions
it was found necessary to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers or else the fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold
to add to the difficulties and dangers of the time masses of seafog came drifting inlandwhite wet clouds which swept by in ghostly fashion so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of seamist swept by
at times the mist cleared and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning which now came thick and fast followed by such sudden peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm
some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interestthe sea running mountains high threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space here and there a fishingboat with a rag of sail running madly for shelter before the blast now and again the white wings of a stormtossed seabird
on the summit of the east cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment but had not yet been tried
the officers in charge of it got it into working order and in the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea
once or twice its service was most effective as when a fishingboat with gunwale under water rushed into the harbour able by the guidance of the sheltering light to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers
as each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on shore a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush
before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails set apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening
the wind had by this time backed to the east and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now was
between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered and with the wind blowing from its present quarter it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour
it was now nearly the hour of high tide but the waves were so great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible and the schooner with all sails set was rushing with such speed that in the words of one old salt she must fetch up somewhere if it was only in hell
then came another rush of seafog greater than any hithertoa mass of dank mist which seemed to close on all things like a grey pall and left available to men only the organ of hearing for the roar of the tempest and the crash of the thunder and the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before
the rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the east pier where the shock was expected and men waited breathless
the wind suddenly shifted to the northeast and the remnant of the seafog melted in the blast and then mirabile dictu between the piers leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed swept the strange schooner before the blast with all sail set and gained the safety of the harbour
the searchlight followed her and a shudder ran through all who saw her for lashed to the helm was a corpse with drooping head which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship
no other form could be seen on deck at all
a great awe came on all as they realised that the ship as if by a miracle had found the harbour unsteered save by the hand of a dead man
however all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words
the schooner paused not but rushing across the harbour pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the southeast corner of the pier jutting under the east cliff known locally as tate hill pier
there was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap
every spar rope and stay was strained and some of the tophammer came crashing down
but strangest of all the very instant the shore was touched an immense dog sprang up on deck from below as if shot up by the concussion and running forward jumped from the bow on the sand
making straight for the steep cliff where the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the east pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstonesthruffsteans or throughstones as they call them in the whitby vernacularactually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away it disappeared in the darkness which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight
it so happened that there was no one at the moment on tate hill pier as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above
thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour who at once ran down to the little pier was the first to climb on board
the men working the searchlight after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there
the coastguard ran aft and when he came beside the wheel bent over to examine it and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion
this seemed to pique general curiosity and quite a number of people began to run
it is a good way round from the west cliff by the drawbridge to tate hill pier but your correspondent is a fairly good runner and came well ahead of the crowd
when i arrived however i found already assembled on the pier a crowd whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board
by the courtesy of the chief boatman i was as your correspondent permitted to climb on deck and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel
it was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised or even awed for not often can such a sight have been seen
the man was simply fastened by his hands tied one over the other to a spoke of the wheel
between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel and all kept fast by the binding cords
the poor fellow may have been seated at one time but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and dragged him to and fro so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone
accurate note was made of the state of things and a doctorsurgeon j
caffyn of 33 east elliot placewho came immediately after me declared after making examination that the man must have been dead for quite two days
in his pocket was a bottle carefully corked empty save for a little roll of paper which proved to be the addendum to the log
the coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands fastening the knots with his teeth
the fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some complications later on in the admiralty court for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict
already however the legal tongues are wagging and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed his property being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain since the tiller as emblemship if not proof of delegated possession is held in a dead hand
it is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till deatha steadfastness as noble as that of the young casabiancaand placed in the mortuary to await inquest
already the sudden storm is passing and its fierceness is abating crowds are scattering homeward and the sky is beginning to redden over the yorkshire wolds
i shall send in time for your next issue further details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into harbour in the storm
whitby 9 august
the sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself
it turns out that the schooner is a russian from varna and is called the demeter
she is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand with only a small amount of cargoa number of great wooden boxes filled with mould
this cargo was consigned to a whitby solicitor mr s
f
billington of 7 the crescent who this morning went aboard and formally took possession of the goods consigned to him
the russian consul too acting for the charterparty took formal possession of the ship and paid all harbour dues etc
nothing is talked about here today except the strange coincidence the officials of the board of trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations
as the matter is to be a nine days wonder they are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after complaint
a good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed when the ship struck and more than a few of the members of the s
c
which is very strong in whitby have tried to befriend the animal
to the general disappointment however it was not to be found it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town
it may be that it was frightened and made its way on to the moors where it is still hiding in terror
there are some who look with dread on such a possibility lest later on it should in itself become a danger for it is evidently a fierce brute
early this morning a large dog a halfbred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to tate hill pier was found dead in the roadway opposite to its masters yard
it had been fighting and manifestly had had a savage opponent for its throat was torn away and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw
by the kindness of the board of trade inspector i have been permitted to look over the logbook of the demeter which was in order up to within three days but contained nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men
the greatest interest however is with regard to the paper found in the bottle which was today produced at the inquest and a more strange narrative than the two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across
as there is no motive for concealment i am permitted to use them and accordingly send you a rescript simply omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo
it almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage
of course my statement must be taken cum grano since i am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the russian consul who kindly translated for me time being short
log of the demeter
varna to whitby
written 18 july things so strange happening that i shall keep accurate note henceforth till we land
on 6 july we finished taking in cargo silver sand and boxes of earth
at noon set sail
east wind fresh
crew five hands
two mates cook and myself captain
on 11 july at dawn entered bosphorus
boarded by turkish customs officers
backsheesh
all correct
under way at 4 pm on 12 july through dardanelles
more customs officers and flagboat of guarding squadron
backsheesh again
work of officers thorough but quick
want us off soon
at dark passed into archipelago
on 13 july passed cape matapan
crew dissatisfied about something
seemed scared but would not speak out
on 14 july was somewhat anxious about crew
men all steady fellows who sailed with me before
mate could not make out what was wrong they only told him there was something and crossed themselves
mate lost temper with one of them that day and struck him
expected fierce quarrel but all was quiet
on 16 july mate reported in the morning that one of crew petrofsky was missing
could not account for it
took larboard watch eight bells last night was relieved by abramoff but did not go to bunk
men more downcast than ever
all said they expected something of the kind but would not say more than there was something aboard
mate getting very impatient with them feared some trouble ahead
on 17 july yesterday one of the men olgaren came to my cabin and in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man aboard the ship
he said that in his watch he had been sheltering behind the deckhouse as there was a rainstorm when he saw a tall thin man who was not like any of the crew come up the companionway and go along the deck forward and disappear
he followed cautiously but when he got to bows found no one and the hatchways were all closed
he was in a panic of superstitious fear and i am afraid the panic may spread
to allay it i shall today search entire ship carefully from stem to stern
later in the day i got together the whole crew and told them as they evidently thought there was some one in the ship we would search from stem to stern
first mate angry said it was folly and to yield to such foolish ideas would demoralise the men said he would engage to keep them out of trouble with a handspike
i let him take the helm while the rest began thorough search all keeping abreast with lanterns we left no corner unsearched
as there were only the big wooden boxes there were no odd corners where a man could hide
men much relieved when search over and went back to work cheerfully
first mate scowled but said nothing
22 july
rough weather last three days and all hands busy with sailsno time to be frightened
men seem to have forgotten their dread
mate cheerful again and all on good terms
praised men for work in bad weather
passed gibralter and out through straits
all well
there seems some doom over this ship
already a hand short and entering on the bay of biscay with wild weather ahead and yet last night another man lostdisappeared
like the first he came off his watch and was not seen again
men all in a panic of fear sent a round robin asking to have double watch as they fear to be alone
mate angry
fear there will be some trouble as either he or the men will do some violence
28 july
four days in hell knocking about in a sort of maelstrom and the wind a tempest
no sleep for any one
men all worn out
hardly know how to set a watch since no one fit to go on
second mate volunteered to steer and watch and let men snatch a few hours sleep
wind abating seas still terrific but feel them less as ship is steadier
29 july
another tragedy
had single watch tonight as crew too tired to double
when morning watch came on deck could find no one except steersman
raised outcry and all came on deck
thorough search but no one found
are now without second mate and crew in a panic
mate and i agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause
30 july
last night
rejoiced we are nearing england
weather fine all sails set
retired worn out slept soundly awaked by mate telling me that both man of watch and steersman missing
only self and mate and two hands left to work ship
two days of fog and not a sail sighted
had hoped when in the english channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere
not having power to work sails have to run before wind
dare not lower as could not raise them again
we seem to be drifting to some terrible doom
mate now more demoralised than either of men
his stronger nature seems to have worked inwardly against himself
men are beyond fear working stolidly and patiently with minds made up to worst
they are russian he roumanian
2 august midnight
woke up from few minutes sleep by hearing a cry seemingly outside my port
could see nothing in fog
rushed on deck and ran against mate
tells me heard cry and ran but no sign of man on watch
one more gone
lord help us
mate says we must be past straits of dover as in a moment of fog lifting he saw north foreland just as he heard the man cry out
if so we are now off in the north sea and only god can guide us in the fog which seems to move with us and god seems to have deserted us
at midnight i went to relieve the man at the wheel and when i got to it found no one there
the wind was steady and as we ran before it there was no yawing
i dared not leave it so shouted for the mate
after a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels
he looked wildeyed and haggard and i greatly fear his reason has given way
he came close to me and whispered hoarsely with his mouth to my ear as though fearing the very air might hear it is here i know it now
on the watch last night i saw it like a man tall and thin and ghastly pale
it was in the bows and looking out
i crept behind it and gave it my knife but the knife went through it empty as the air
and as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into space
then he went on but it is here and ill find it
it is in the hold perhaps in one of those boxes
ill unscrew them one by one and see
you work the helm
and with a warning look and his finger on his lip he went below
there was springing up a choppy wind and i could not leave the helm
i saw him come out on deck again with a toolchest and a lantern and go down the forward hatchway
he is mad stark raving mad and its no use my trying to stop him
he cant hurt those big boxes they are invoiced as clay and to pull them about is as harmless a thing as he can do
so here i stay and mind the helm and write these notes
i can only trust in god and wait till the fog clears
then if i cant steer to any harbour with the wind that is i shall cut down sails and lie by and signal for help
it is nearly all over now
just as i was beginning to hope that the mate would come out calmerfor i heard him knocking away at something in the hold and work is good for himthere came up the hatchway a sudden startled scream which made my blood run cold and up on the deck he came as if shot from a guna raging madman with his eyes rolling and his face convulsed with fear
save me
he cried and then looked round on the blanket of fog
his horror turned to despair and in a steady voice he said you had better come too captain before it is too late
he is there
i know the secret now
the sea will save me from him and it is all that is left
before i could say a word or move forward to seize him he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea
i suppose i know the secret too now
it was this madman who had got rid of the men one by one and now he has followed them himself
how am i to account for all these horrors when i get to port
when i get to port
will that ever be
4 august
still fog which the sunrise cannot pierce
i know there is sunrise because i am a sailor why else i know not
i dared not go below i dared not leave the helm so here all night i stayed and in the dimness of the night i saw ithim
god forgive me but the mate was right to jump overboard
it was better to die like a man to die like a sailor in blue water no man can object
but i am captain and i must not leave my ship
but i shall baffle this fiend or monster for i shall tie my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail and along with them i shall tie that which heit
dare not touch and then come good wind or foul i shall save my soul and my honour as a captain
i am growing weaker and the night is coming on
if he can look me in the face again i may not have time to act
if we are wrecked mayhap this bottle may be found and those who find it may understand if not
well then all men shall know that i have been true to my trust
god and the blessed virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying to do his duty
of course the verdict was an open one
there is no evidence to adduce and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now none to say
the folk here hold almost universally that the captain is simply a hero and he is to be given a public funeral
already it is arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the esk for a piece and then brought back to tate hill pier and up the abbey steps for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff
the owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as wishing to follow him to the grave
no trace has ever been found of the great dog at which there is much mourning for with public opinion in its present state he would i believe be adopted by the town
tomorrow will see the funeral and so will end this one more mystery of the sea
8 august
lucy was very restless all night and i too could not sleep
the storm was fearful and as it boomed loudly among the chimneypots it made me shudder
when a sharp puff came it seemed to be like a distant gun
strangely enough lucy did not wake but she got up twice and dressed herself
fortunately each time i awoke in time and managed to undress her without waking her and got her back to bed
it is a very strange thing this sleepwalking for as soon as her will is thwarted in any physical way her intention if there be any disappears and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her life
early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night
there were very few people about and though the sun was bright and the air clear and fresh the big grimlooking waves that seemed dark themselves because the foam that topped them was like snow forced themselves in through the narrow mouth of the harbourlike a bullying man going through a crowd
somehow i felt glad that jonathan was not on the sea last night but on land
but oh is he on land or sea
where is he and how
i am getting fearfully anxious about him
if i only knew what to do and could do anything
10 august
the funeral of the poor seacaptain today was most touching
every boat in the harbour seemed to be there and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from tate hill pier up to the churchyard
lucy came with me and we went early to our old seat whilst the cortge of boats went up the river to the viaduct and came down again
we had a lovely view and saw the procession nearly all the way
the poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on it when the time came and saw everything
poor lucy seemed much upset
she was restless and uneasy all the time and i cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her
she is quite odd in one thing she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness or if there be she does not understand it herself
there is an additional cause in that poor old mr swales was found dead this morning on our seat his neck being broken
he had evidently as the doctor said fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder
poor dear old man
perhaps he had seen death with his dying eyes
lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other people do
just now she was quite upset by a little thing which i did not much heed though i am myself very fond of animals
one of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog
the dog is always with him
they are both quiet persons and i never saw the man angry nor heard the dog bark
during the service the dog would not come to its master who was on the seat with us but kept a few yards off barking and howling
its master spoke to it gently and then harshly and then angrily but it would neither come nor cease to make a noise
it was in a sort of fury with its eyes savage and all its hairs bristling out like a cats tail when puss is on the warpath
finally the man too got angry and jumped down and kicked the dog and then took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed
the moment it touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble
it did not try to get away but crouched down quivering and cowering and was in such a pitiable state of terror that i tried though without effect to comfort it
lucy was full of pity too but she did not attempt to touch the dog but looked at it in an agonised sort of way
i greatly fear that she is of too supersensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble
she will be dreaming of this tonight i am sure
the whole agglomeration of thingsthe ship steered into port by a dead man his attitude tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads the touching funeral the dog now furious and now in terrorwill all afford material for her dreams
i think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically so i shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to robin hoods bay and back
she ought not to have much inclination for sleepwalking then
same day 11 oclock pm oh but i am tired
if it were not that i had made my diary a duty i should not open it tonight
we had a lovely walk
lucy after a while was in gay spirits owing i think to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse and frightened the wits out of us
i believe we forgot everything except of course personal fear and it seemed to wipe the slate clean and give us a fresh start
we had a capital severe tea at robin hoods bay in a sweet little oldfashioned inn with a bowwindow right over the seaweedcovered rocks of the strand
i believe we should have shocked the new woman with our appetites
men are more tolerant bless them
then we walked home with some or rather many stoppages to rest and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls
lucy was really tired and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could
the young curate came in however and mr
westenra asked him to stay for supper
lucy and i had both a fight for it with the dusty miller i know it was a hard fight on my part and i am quite heroic
i think that some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates who dont take supper no matter how they may be pressed to and who will know when girls are tired
lucy is asleep and breathing softly
she has more colour in her cheeks than usual and looks oh so sweet
if mr holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the drawingroom i wonder what he would say if he saw her now
some of the new women writers will some day start an idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or accepting
but i suppose the new woman wont condescend in future to accept she will do the proposing herself
and a nice job she will make of it too
theres some consolation in that
i am so happy tonight because dear lucy seems better
i really believe she has turned the corner and that we are over her troubles with dreaming
i should be quite happy if i only knew if jonathan
god bless and keep him
11 august 3 am diary again
no sleep now so i may as well write
i am too agitated to sleep
we have had such an adventure such an agonising experience
i fell asleep as soon as i had closed my diary
suddenly i became broad awake and sat up with a horrible sense of fear upon me and of some feeling of emptiness around me
the room was dark so i could not see lucys bed i stole across and felt for her
the bed was empty
i lit a match and found that she was not in the room
the door was shut but not locked as i had left it
i feared to wake her mother who has been more than usually ill lately so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her
as i was leaving the room it struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her dreaming intention
dressinggown would mean house dress outside
dressinggown and dress were both in their places
thank god i said to myself she cannot be far as she is only in her nightdress
i ran downstairs and looked in the sittingroom
not there
then i looked in all the other open rooms of the house with an evergrowing fear chilling my heart
finally i came to the hall door and found it open
it was not wide open but the catch of the lock had not caught
the people of the house are careful to lock the door every night so i feared that lucy must have gone out as she was
there was no time to think of what might happen a vague overmastering fear obscured all details
i took a big heavy shawl and ran out
the clock was striking one as i was in the crescent and there was not a soul in sight
i ran along the north terrace but could see no sign of the white figure which i expected
at the edge of the west cliff above the pier i looked across the harbour to the east cliff in the hope or feari dont know whichof seeing lucy in our favourite seat
there was a bright full moon with heavy black driving clouds which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed across
for a moment or two i could see nothing as the shadow of a cloud obscured st
marys church and all around it
then as the cloud passed i could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a swordcut moved along the church and the churchyard became gradually visible
whatever my expectation was it was not disappointed for there on our favourite seat the silver light of the moon struck a halfreclining figure snowy white
the coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much for shadow shut down on light almost immediately but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone and bent over it
what it was whether man or beast i could not tell i did not wait to catch another glance but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the fishmarket to the bridge which was the only way to reach the east cliff
the town seemed as dead for not a soul did i see i rejoiced that it was so for i wanted no witness of poor lucys condition
the time and distance seemed endless and my knees trembled and my breath came laboured as i toiled up the endless steps to the abbey
i must have gone fast and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead and as though every joint in my body were rusty
when i got almost to the top i could see the seat and the white figure for i was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow
there was undoubtedly something long and black bending over the halfreclining white figure
i called in fright lucy
and something raised a head and from where i was i could see a white face and red gleaming eyes
lucy did not answer and i ran on to the entrance of the churchyard
as i entered the church was between me and the seat and for a minute or so i lost sight of her
when i came in view again the cloud had passed and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that i could see lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat
she was quite alone and there was not a sign of any living thing about
when i bent over her i could see that she was still asleep
her lips were parted and she was breathingnot softly as usual with her but in long heavy gasps as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath
as i came close she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar of her nightdress close around her throat
whilst she did so there came a little shudder through her as though she felt the cold
i flung the warm shawl over her and drew the edges tight round her neck for i dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air unclad as she was
i feared to wake her all at once so in order to have my hands free that i might help her i fastened the shawl at her throat with a big safetypin but i must have been clumsy in my anxiety and pinched or pricked her with it for byandby when her breathing became quieter she put her hand to her throat again and moaned
when i had her carefully wrapped up i put my shoes on her feet and then began very gently to wake her
at first she did not respond but gradually she became more and more uneasy in her sleep moaning and sighing occasionally
at last as time was passing fast and for many other reasons i wished to get her home at once i shook her more forcibly till finally she opened her eyes and awoke
she did not seem surprised to see me as of course she did not realise all at once where she was
lucy always wakes prettily and even at such a time when her body must have been chilled with cold and her mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad in a churchyard at night she did not lose her grace
she trembled a little and clung to me when i told her to come at once with me home she rose without a word with the obedience of a child
as we passed along the gravel hurt my feet and lucy noticed me wince
she stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes but i would not
however when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard where there was a puddle of water remaining from the storm i daubed my feet with mud using each foot in turn on the other so that as we went home no one in case we should meet any one should notice my bare feet
fortune favoured us and we got home without meeting a soul
once we saw a man who seemed not quite sober passing along a street in front of us but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as there are here steep little closes or wynds as they call them in scotland
my heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes i thought i should faint
i was filled with anxiety about lucy not only for her health lest she should suffer from the exposure but for her reputation in case the story should get wind
when we got in and had washed our feet and had said a prayer of thankfulness together i tucked her into bed
before falling asleep she askedeven imploredme not to say a word to any one even her mother about her sleepwalking adventure
i hesitated at first to promise but on thinking of the state of her mothers health and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her and thinking too of how such a story might become distortednay infallibly wouldin case it should leak out i thought it wiser to do so
i hope i did right
i have locked the door and the key is tied to my wrist so perhaps i shall not be again disturbed
lucy is sleeping soundly the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea
same day noon
all goes well
lucy slept till i woke her and seemed not to have even changed her side
the adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed her on the contrary it has benefited her for she looks better this morning than she has done for weeks
i was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safetypin hurt her
indeed it might have been serious for the skin of her throat was pierced
i must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it for there are two little red points like pinpricks and on the band of her nightdress was a drop of blood
when i apologised and was concerned about it she laughed and petted me and said she did not even feel it
fortunately it cannot leave a scar as it is so tiny
same day night
we passed a happy day
the air was clear and the sun bright and there was a cool breeze
we took our lunch to mulgrave woods mr
westenra driving by the road and lucy and i walking by the cliffpath and joining her at the gate
i felt a little sad myself for i could not but feel how absolutely happy it would have been had jonathan been with me
but there
i must only be patient
in the evening we strolled in the casino terrace and heard some good music by spohr and mackenzie and went to bed early
lucy seems more restful than she has been for some time and fell asleep at once
i shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before though i do not expect any trouble tonight
12 august
my expectations were wrong for twice during the night i was wakened by lucy trying to get out
she seemed even in her sleep to be a little impatient at finding the door shut and went back to bed under a sort of protest
i woke with the dawn and heard the birds chirping outside of the window
lucy woke too and i was glad to see was even better than on the previous morning
all her old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back and she came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about arthur
i told her how anxious i was about jonathan and then she tried to comfort me
well she succeeded somewhat for though sympathy cant alter facts it can help to make them more bearable
13 august
another quiet day and to bed with the key on my wrist as before
again i awoke in the night and found lucy sitting up in bed still asleep pointing to the window
i got up quietly and pulling aside the blind looked out
it was brilliant moonlight and the soft effect of the light over the sea and skymerged together in one great silent mysterywas beautiful beyond words
between me and the moonlight flitted a great bat coming and going in great whirling circles
once or twice it came quite close but was i suppose frightened at seeing me and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey
when i came back from the window lucy had lain down again and was sleeping peacefully
she did not stir again all night
14 august
on the east cliff reading and writing all day
lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot as i am and it is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner
this afternoon she made a funny remark
we were coming home for dinner and had come to the top of the steps up from the west pier and stopped to look at the view as we generally do
the setting sun low down in the sky was just dropping behind kettleness the red light was thrown over on the east cliff and the old abbey and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow
we were silent for a while and suddenly lucy murmured as if to herself his red eyes again
they are just the same
it was such an odd expression coming apropos of nothing that it quite startled me
i slewed round a little so as to see lucy well without seeming to stare at her and saw that she was in a halfdreamy state with an odd look on her face that i could not quite make out so i said nothing but followed her eyes
she appeared to be looking over at our own seat whereon was a dark figure seated alone
i was a little startled myself for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames but a second look dispelled the illusion
the red sunlight was shining on the windows of st
marys church behind our seat and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved
i called lucys attention to the peculiar effect and she became herself with a start but she looked sad all the same it may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up there
we never refer to it so i said nothing and we went home to dinner
lucy had a headache and went early to bed
i saw her asleep and went out for a little stroll myself i walked along the cliffs to the westward and was full of sweet sadness for i was thinking of jonathan
when coming homeit was then bright moonlight so bright that though the front of our part of the crescent was in shadow everything could be well seeni threw a glance up at our window and saw lucys head leaning out
i thought that perhaps she was looking out for me so i opened my handkerchief and waved it
she did not notice or make any movement whatever
just then the moonlight crept round an angle of the building and the light fell on the window
there distinctly was lucy with her head lying up against the side of the windowsill and her eyes shut
she was fast asleep and by her seated on the windowsill was something that looked like a goodsized bird
i was afraid she might get a chill so i ran upstairs but as i came into the room she was moving back to her bed fast asleep and breathing heavily she was holding her hand to her throat as though to protect it from cold
i did not wake her but tucked her up warmly i have taken care that the door is locked and the window securely fastened
she looks so sweet as she sleeps but she is paler than is her wont and there is a drawn haggard look under her eyes which i do not like
i fear she is fretting about something
i wish i could find out what it is
15 august
rose later than usual
lucy was languid and tired and slept on after we had been called
we had a happy surprise at breakfast
arthurs father is better and wants the marriage to come off soon
lucy is full of quiet joy and her mother is glad and sorry at once
later on in the day she told me the cause
she is grieved to lose lucy as her very own but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to protect her
poor dear sweet lady
she confided to me that she has got her deathwarrant
she has not told lucy and made me promise secrecy her doctor told her that within a few months at most she must die for her heart is weakening
at any time even now a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her
ah we were wise to keep from her the affair of the dreadful night of lucys sleepwalking
17 august
no diary for two whole days
i have not had the heart to write
some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness
no news from jonathan and lucy seems to be growing weaker whilst her mothers hours are numbering to a close
i do not understand lucys fading away as she is doing
she eats well and sleeps well and enjoys the fresh air but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading and she gets weaker and more languid day by day at night i hear her gasping as if for air
i keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at night but she gets up and walks about the room and sits at the open window
last night i found her leaning out when i woke up and when i tried to wake her i could not she was in a faint
when i managed to restore her she was as weak as water and cried silently between long painful struggles for breath
when i asked her how she came to be at the window she shook her head and turned away
i trust her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the safetypin
i looked at her throat just now as she lay asleep and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed
they are still open and if anything larger than before and the edges of them are faintly white
they are like little white dots with red centres
unless they heal within a day or two i shall insist on the doctor seeing about them

18 august
i am happy today and write sitting on the seat in the churchyard
lucy is ever so much better
last night she slept well all night and did not disturb me once
the roses seem coming back already to her cheeks though she is still sadly pale and wanlooking
if she were in any way anmic i could understand it but she is not
she is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness
all the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her and she has just reminded me as if i needed any reminding of that night and that it was here on this very seat i found her asleep
as she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said my poor little feet didnt make much noise then
i daresay poor old mr swales would have told me that it was because i didnt want to wake up geordie
as she was in such a communicative humour i asked her if she had dreamed at all that night
before she answered that sweet puckered look came into her forehead which arthuri call him arthur from her habitsays he loves and indeed i dont wonder that he does
then she went on in a halfdreaming kind of way as if trying to recall it to herself i didnt quite dream but it all seemed to be real
i only wanted to be here in this spoti dont know why for i was afraid of somethingi dont know what
i remember though i suppose i was asleep passing through the streets and over the bridge
a fish leaped as i went by and i leaned over to look at it and i heard a lot of dogs howlingthe whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at onceas i went up the steps
then i had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes just as we saw in the sunset and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once and then i seemed sinking into deep green water and there was a singing in my ears as i have heard there is to drowning men and then everything seemed passing away from me my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air
i seem to remember that once the west lighthouse was right under me and then there was a sort of agonising feeling as if i were in an earthquake and i came back and found you shaking my body
i saw you do it before i felt you
then she began to laugh
it seemed a little uncanny to me and i listened to her breathlessly
i did not quite like it and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject so we drifted on to other subjects and lucy was like her old self again
when we got home the fresh breeze had braced her up and her pale cheeks were really more rosy
her mother rejoiced when she saw her and we all spent a very happy evening together
19 august
joy joy joy
although not all joy
at last news of jonathan
the dear fellow has been ill that is why he did not write
i am not afraid to think it or say it now that i know
mr hawkins sent me on the letter and wrote himself oh so kindly
i am to leave in the morning and go over to jonathan and to help to nurse him if necessary and to bring him home
mr hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if we were to be married out there
i have cried over the good sisters letter till i can feel it wet against my bosom where it lies
it is of jonathan and must be next my heart for he is in my heart
my journey is all mapped out and my luggage ready
i am only taking one change of dress lucy will bring my trunk to london and keep it till i send for it for it may be that
i must write no more i must keep it to say to jonathan my husband
the letter that he has seen and touched must comfort me till we meet
letter sister agatha hospital of st
joseph and ste
mary budapesth to miss wilhelmina murray
dear madam i write by desire of mr jonathan harker who is himself not strong enough to write though progressing well thanks to god and st
mary
he has been under our care for nearly six weeks suffering from a violent brain fever
he wishes me to convey his love and to say that by this post i write for him to mr peter hawkins exeter to say with his dutiful respects that he is sorry for his delay and that all of his work is completed
he will require some few weeks rest in our sanatorium in the hills but will then return
he wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him and that he would like to pay for his staying here so that others who need shall not be wanting for help
believe me yours with sympathy and all blessings sister agatha
my patient being asleep i open this to let you know something more
he has told me all about you and that you are shortly to be his wife
all blessings to you both
he has had some fearful shockso says our doctorand in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful of wolves and poison and blood of ghosts and demons and i fear to say of what
be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him of this kind for a long time to come the traces of such an illness as his do not lightly die away
we should have written long ago but we knew nothing of his friends and there was on him nothing that any one could understand
he came in the train from klausenburg and the guard was told by the stationmaster there that he rushed into the station shouting for a ticket for home
seeing from his violent demeanour that he was english they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the way thither that the train reached
be assured that he is well cared for
he has won all hearts by his sweetness and gentleness
he is truly getting on well and i have no doubt will in a few weeks be all himself
but be careful of him for safetys sake
there are i pray god and st
mary many many happy years for you both
strange and sudden change in renfield last night
about eight oclock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when setting
the attendant was struck by his manner and knowing my interest in him encouraged him to talk
he is usually respectful to the attendant and at times servile but tonight the man tells me he was quite haughty
would not condescend to talk with him at all
all he would say was i dont want to talk to you you dont count now the master is at hand
the attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has seized him
if so we must look out for squalls for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous
the combination is a dreadful one
at nine oclock i visited him myself
his attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant in his sublime selffeeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him as nothing
it looks like religious mania and he will soon think that he himself is god
these infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too paltry for an omnipotent being
how these madmen give themselves away
the real god taketh heed lest a sparrow fall but the god created from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow
oh if men only knew
for half an hour or more renfield kept getting excited in greater and greater degree
i did not pretend to be watching him but i kept strict observation all the same
all at once that shifty look came into his eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to know so well
he became quite quiet and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly and looked into space with lacklustre eyes
i thought i would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed and tried to lead him to talk of his pets a theme which had never failed to excite his attention
at first he made no reply but at length said testily bother them all
i dont care a pin about them
i said
you dont mean to tell me you dont care about spiders
spiders at present are his hobby and the notebook is filling up with columns of small figures
to this he answered enigmatically the bridemaidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride but when the bride draweth nigh then the maidens shine not to the eyes that are filled
he would not explain himself but remained obstinately seated on his bed all the time i remained with him
i am weary tonight and low in spirits
i cannot but think of lucy and how different things might have been
i must be careful not to let it grow into a habit
no i shall take none tonight
i have thought of lucy and i shall not dishonour her by mixing the two
if need be tonight shall be sleepless
glad i made the resolution gladder that i kept to it
i had lain tossing about and had heard the clock strike only twice when the nightwatchman came to me sent up from the ward to say that renfield had escaped
i threw on my clothes and ran down at once my patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about
those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers
the attendant was waiting for me
he said he had seen him not ten minutes before seemingly asleep in his bed when he had looked through the observationtrap in the door
his attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out
he ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window and had at once sent up for me
he was only in his nightgear and cannot be far off
the attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to follow him as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out of the building by the door
he is a bulky man and couldnt get through the window
i am thin so with his aid i got out but feet foremost and as we were only a few feet above ground landed unhurt
the attendant told me the patient had gone to the left and had taken a straight line so i ran as quickly as i could
as i got through the belt of trees i saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house
i ran back at once told the watchman to get three or four men immediately and follow me into the grounds of carfax in case our friend might be dangerous
i got a ladder myself and crossing the wall dropped down on the other side
i could see renfields figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house so i ran after him
on the far side of the house i found him pressed close against the old ironbound oak door of the chapel
he was talking apparently to some one but i was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying lest i might frighten him and he should run off
chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic when the fit of escaping is upon him
after a few minutes however i could see that he did not take note of anything around him and so ventured to draw nearer to himthe more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in
i heard him say i am here to do your bidding master
i am your slave and you will reward me for i shall be faithful
i have worshipped you long and afar off
now that you are near i await your commands and you will not pass me by will you dear master in your distribution of good things
he is a selfish old beggar anyhow
he thinks of the loaves and fishes even when he believes he is in a real presence
his manias make a startling combination
when we closed in on him he fought like a tiger
he is immensely strong for he was more like a wild beast than a man
i never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before and i hope i shall not again
it is a mercy that we have found out his strength and his danger in good time
with strength and determination like his he might have done wild work before he was caged
he is safe now at any rate
jack sheppard himself couldnt get free from the straitwaistcoat that keeps him restrained and hes chained to the wall in the padded room
his cries are at times awful but the silences that follow are more deadly still for he means murder in every turn and movement
just now he spoke coherent words for the first time i shall be patient master
it is comingcomingcoming
so i took the hint and came too
i was too excited to sleep but this diary has quieted me and i feel i shall get some sleep tonight
budapesth 24 august
my dearest lucy i know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we parted at the railway station at whitby
well my dear i got to hull all right and caught the boat to hamburg and then the train on here
i feel that i can hardly recall anything of the journey except that i knew i was coming to jonathan and that as i should have to do some nursing i had better get all the sleep i could
i found my dear one oh so thin and pale and weaklooking
all the resolution has gone out of his dear eyes and that quiet dignity which i told you was in his face has vanished
he is only a wreck of himself and he does not remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past
at least he wants me to believe so and i shall never ask
he has had some terrible shock and i fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try to recall it
sister agatha who is a good creature and a born nurse tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head
i wanted her to tell me what they were but she would only cross herself and say she would never tell that the ravings of the sick were the secrets of god and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear them she should respect her trust
she is a sweet good soul and the next day when she saw i was troubled she opened up the subject again and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved about added i can tell you this much my dear that it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself and you as his wife to be have no cause to be concerned
he has not forgotten you or what he owes to you
his fear was of great and terrible things which no mortal can treat of
i do believe the dear soul thought i might be jealous lest my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl
the idea of my being jealous about jonathan
and yet my dear let me whisper i felt a thrill of joy through me when i knew that no other woman was a cause of trouble
i am now sitting by his bedside where i can see his face while he sleeps
he is waking
when he woke he asked me for his coat as he wanted to get something from the pocket i asked sister agatha and she brought all his things
i saw that amongst them was his notebook and was going to ask him to let me look at itfor i knew then that i might find some clue to his troublebut i suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes for he sent me over to the window saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment
then he called me back and when i came he had his hand over the notebook and he said to me very solemnly wilhelminai knew then that he was in deadly earnest for he has never called me by that name since he asked me to marry himyou know dear my ideas of the trust between husband and wife there should be no secret no concealment
i have had a great shock and when i try to think of what it is i feel my head spin round and i do not know if it was all real or the dreaming of a madman
you know i have had brain fever and that is to be mad
the secret is here and i do not want to know it
i want to take up my life here with our marriage
for my dear we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are complete
are you willing wilhelmina to share my ignorance
here is the book
take it and keep it read it if you will but never let me know unless indeed some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to the bitter hours asleep or awake sane or mad recorded here
he fell back exhausted and i put the book under his pillow and kissed him
i have asked sister agatha to beg the superior to let our wedding be this afternoon and am waiting her reply
she has come and told me that the chaplain of the english mission church has been sent for
we are to be married in an hour or as soon after as jonathan awakes
lucy the time has come and gone
i feel very solemn but very very happy
jonathan woke a little after the hour and all was ready and he sat up in bed propped up with pillows
he answered his i will firmly and strongly
i could hardly speak my heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me
the dear sisters were so kind
please god i shall never never forget them nor the grave and sweet responsibilities i have taken upon me
i must tell you of my wedding present
when the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husbandoh lucy it is the first time i have written the words my husbandleft me alone with my husband i took the book from under his pillow and wrapped it up in white paper and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck and sealed it over the knot with sealingwax and for my seal i used my wedding ring
then i kissed it and showed it to my husband and told him that i would keep it so and then it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each other that i would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty
then he took my hand in his and oh lucy it was the first time he took his wifes hand and said that it was the dearest thing in all the wide world and that he would go through all the past again to win it if need be
the poor dear meant to have said a part of the past but he cannot think of time yet and i shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month but the year
well my dear what could i say
i could only tell him that i was the happiest woman in all the wide world and that i had nothing to give him except myself my life and my trust and that with these went my love and duty for all the days of my life
and my dear when he kissed me and drew me to him with his poor weak hands it was like a very solemn pledge between us
lucy dear do you know why i tell you all this
it is not only because it is all sweet to me but because you have been and are very dear to me
it was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life
i want you to see now and with the eyes of a very happy wife whither duty has led me so that in your own married life you too may be all happy as i am
my dear please almighty god your life may be all it promises a long day of sunshine with no harsh wind no forgetting duty no distrust
i must not wish you no pain for that can never be but i do hope you will be always as happy as i am now
goodbye my dear
i shall post this at once and perhaps write you very soon again
i must stop for jonathan is wakingi must attend to my husband
your everloving mina harker
letter lucy westenra to mina harker
whitby 30 august
my dearest mina oceans of love and millions of kisses and may you soon be in your own home with your husband
i wish you could be coming home soon enough to stay with us here
the strong air would soon restore jonathan it has quite restored me
i have an appetite like a cormorant am full of life and sleep well
you will be glad to know that i have quite given up walking in my sleep
i think i have not stirred out of my bed for a week that is when i once got into it at night
arthur says i am getting fat
by the way i forgot to tell you that arthur is here
we have such walks and drives and rides and rowing and tennis and fishing together and i love him more than ever
he tells me that he loves me more but i doubt that for at first he told me that he couldnt love me more than he did then
but this is nonsense
there he is calling to me
so no more just at present from your loving lucy
mother sends her love
she seems better poor dear
we are to be married on 28 september
20 august
the case of renfield grows even more interesting
he has now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion
for the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent
then one night just as the moon rose he grew quiet and kept murmuring to himself now i can wait now i can wait
the attendant came to tell me so i ran down at once to have a look at him
he was still in the straitwaistcoat and in the padded room but the suffused look had gone from his face and his eyes had something of their old pleadingi might almost say cringingsoftness
i was satisfied with his present condition and directed him to be relieved
the attendants hesitated but finally carried out my wishes without protest
it was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust for coming close to me he said in a whisper all the while looking furtively at them they think i could hurt you
fancy me hurting you
the fools
it was soothing somehow to the feelings to find myself dissociated even in the mind of this poor madman from the others but all the same i do not follow his thought
am i to take it that i have anything in common with him so that we are as it were to stand together or has he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my wellbeing is needful to him
i must find out later on
tonight he will not speak
even the offer of a kitten or even a fullgrown cat will not tempt him
he will only say i dont take any stock in cats
i have more to think of now and i can wait i can wait
after a while i left him
the attendant tells me that he was quiet until just before dawn and that then he began to get uneasy and at length violent until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted him so that he swooned into a sort of coma
three nights has the same thing happenedviolent all day then quiet from moonrise to sunrise
i wish i could get some clue to the cause
it would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went
happy thought
we shall tonight play sane wits against mad ones
he escaped before without our help tonight he shall escape with it
we shall give him a chance and have the men ready to follow in case they are required
23 august
the unexpected always happens
how well disraeli knew life
our bird when he found the cage open would not fly so all our subtle arrangements were for nought
at any rate we have proved one thing that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time
we shall in future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day
i have given orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room when once he is quiet until an hour before sunrise
the poor souls body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it
the unexpected again
i am called the patient has once more escaped
another night adventure
renfield artfully waited until the attendant was entering the room to inspect
then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage
i sent word for the attendants to follow
again he went into the grounds of the deserted house and we found him in the same place pressed against the old chapel door
when he saw me he became furious and had not the attendants seized him in time he would have tried to kill me
as we were holding him a strange thing happened
he suddenly redoubled his efforts and then as suddenly grew calm
i looked round instinctively but could see nothing
then i caught the patients eye and followed it but could trace nothing as it looked into the moonlit sky except a big bat which was flapping its silent and ghostly way to the west
bats usually wheel and flit about but this one seemed to go straight on as if it knew where it was bound for or had some intention of its own
the patient grew calmer every instant and presently said you neednt tie me i shall go quietly
without trouble we came back to the house
i feel there is something ominous in his calm and shall not forget this night
lucy westenras diary hillingham 24 august
i must imitate mina and keep writing things down
then we can have long talks when we do meet
i wonder when it will be
i wish she were with me again for i feel so unhappy
last night i seemed to be dreaming again just as i was at whitby
perhaps it is the change of air or getting home again
it is all dark and horrid to me for i can remember nothing but i am full of vague fear and i feel so weak and worn out
when arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved when he saw me and i hadnt the spirit to try to be cheerful
i wonder if i could sleep in mothers room tonight
i shall make an excuse and try
25 august
another bad night
mother did not seem to take to my proposal
she seems not too well herself and doubtless she fears to worry me
i tried to keep awake and succeeded for a while but when the clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze so i must have been falling asleep
there was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window but i did not mind it and as i remember no more i suppose i must then have fallen asleep
more bad dreams
i wish i could remember them
this morning i am horribly weak
my face is ghastly pale and my throat pains me
it must be something wrong with my lungs for i dont seem ever to get air enough
i shall try to cheer up when arthur comes or else i know he will be miserable to see me so
letter arthur holmwood to dr seward
albemarle hotel 31 august
my dear jack i want you to do me a favour
lucy is ill that is she has no special disease but she looks awful and is getting worse every day
i have asked her if there is any cause i do not dare to ask her mother for to disturb the poor ladys mind about her daughter in her present state of health would be fatal
westenra has confided to me that her doom is spokendisease of the heartthough poor lucy does not know it yet
i am sure that there is something preying on my dear girls mind
i am almost distracted when i think of her to look at her gives me a pang
i told her i should ask you to see her and though she demurred at firsti know why old fellowshe finally consented
it will be a painful task for you i know old friend but it is for her sake and i must not hesitate to ask or you to act
you are to come to lunch at hillingham tomorrow two oclock so as not to arouse any suspicion in mr
westenra and after lunch lucy will take an opportunity of being alone with you
i shall come in for tea and we can go away together i am filled with anxiety and want to consult with you alone as soon as i can after you have seen her
do not fail

letter from dr seward to arthur holmwood
2 september
my dear old fellow with regard to miss westenras health i hasten to let you know at once that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady that i know of
at the same time i am not by any means satisfied with her appearance she is woefully different from what she was when i saw her last
of course you must bear in mind that i did not have full opportunity of examination such as i should wish our very friendship makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can bridge over
i had better tell you exactly what happened leaving you to draw in a measure your own conclusions
i shall then say what i have done and propose doing
i found miss westenra in seemingly gay spirits
her mother was present and in a few seconds i made up my mind that she was trying all she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious
i have no doubt she guesses if she does not know what need of caution there is
we lunched alone and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful we got as some kind of reward for our labours some real cheerfulness amongst us
then mr
westenra went to lie down and lucy was left with me
we went into her boudoir and till we got there her gaiety remained for the servants were coming and going
as soon as the door was closed however the mask fell from her face and she sank down into a chair with a great sigh and hid her eyes with her hand
when i saw that her high spirits had failed i at once took advantage of her reaction to make a diagnosis
she said to me very sweetly i cannot tell you how i loathe talking about myself
i reminded her that a doctors confidence was sacred but that you were grievously anxious about her
she caught on to my meaning at once and settled that matter in a word
tell arthur everything you choose
i do not care for myself but all for him
so i am quite free
i could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless but i could not see the usual anmic signs and by a chance i was actually able to test the quality of her blood for in opening a window which was stiff a cord gave way and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass
it was a slight matter in itself but it gave me an evident chance and i secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them
the qualitative analysis gives a quite normal condition and shows i should infer in itself a vigorous state of health
in other physical matters i was quite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety but as there must be a cause somewhere i have come to the conclusion that it must be something mental
she complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at times and of heavy lethargic sleep with dreams that frighten her but regarding which she can remember nothing
she says that as a child she used to walk in her sleep and that when in whitby the habit came back and that once she walked out in the night and went to east cliff where miss murray found her but she assures me that of late the habit has not returned
i am in doubt and so have done the best thing i know of i have written to my old friend and master professor van helsing of amsterdam who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world
i have asked him to come over and as you told me that all things were to be at your charge i have mentioned to him who you are and your relations to miss westenra
this my dear fellow is in obedience to your wishes for i am only too proud and happy to do anything i can for her
van helsing would i know do anything for me for a personal reason so no matter on what ground he comes we must accept his wishes
he is a seemingly arbitrary man but this is because he knows what he is talking about better than any one else
he is a philosopher and a metaphysician and one of the most advanced scientists of his day and he has i believe an absolutely open mind
this with an iron nerve a temper of the icebrook an indomitable resolution selfcommand and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings and the kindliest and truest heart that beatsthese form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for mankindwork both in theory and practice for his views are as wide as his allembracing sympathy
i tell you these facts that you may know why i have such confidence in him
i have asked him to come at once
i shall see miss westenra tomorrow again
she is to meet me at the stores so that i may not alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call
yours always john seward
letter abraham van helsing m
ph
lit
etc
to dr seward
my good friend when i have received your letter i am already coming to you
by good fortune i can leave just at once without wrong to any of those who have trusted me
were fortune other then it were bad for those who have trusted for i come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds dear
tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other friend too nervous let slip you did more for him when he wants my aids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do
but it is pleasure added to do for him your friend it is to you that i come
have then rooms for me at the great eastern hotel so that i may be near to hand and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too late on tomorrow for it is likely that i may have to return here that night
but if need be i shall come again in three days and stay longer if it must
till then goodbye my friend john

letter dr seward to hon
3 september
my dear art van helsing has come and gone
he came on with me to hillingham and found that by lucys discretion her mother was lunching out so that we were alone with her
van helsing made a very careful examination of the patient
he is to report to me and i shall advise you for of course i was not present all the time
he is i fear much concerned but says he must think
when i told him of our friendship and how you trust to me in the matter he said you must tell him all you think
tell him what i think if you can guess it if you will
nay i am not jesting
this is no jest but life and death perhaps more
i asked what he meant by that for he was very serious
this was when we had come back to town and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his return to amsterdam
he would not give me any further clue
you must not be angry with me art because his very reticence means that all his brains are working for her good
he will speak plainly enough when the time comes be sure
so i told him i would simply write an account of our visit just as if i were doing a descriptive special article for the daily telegraph
he seemed not to notice but remarked that the smuts in london were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a student here
i am to get his report tomorrow if he can possibly make it
in any case i am to have a letter
well as to the visit
lucy was more cheerful than on the day i first saw her and certainly looked better
she had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you and her breathing was normal
she was very sweet to the professor as she always is and tried to make him feel at ease though i could see that the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it
i believe van helsing saw it too for i saw the quick look under his bushy brows that i knew of old
then he began to chat of all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite geniality that i could see poor lucys pretense of animation merge into reality
then without any seeming change he brought the conversation gently round to his visit and suavely said my dear young miss i have the so great pleasure because you are so much beloved
that is much my dear ever were there that which i do not see
they told me you were down in the spirit and that you were of a ghastly pale
to them i say pouf
and he snapped his fingers at me and went on but you and i shall show them how wrong they are
how can heand he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with which once he pointed me out to his class on or rather after a particular occasion which he never fails to remind me ofknow anything of a young ladies
he has his madmans to play with and to bring them back to happiness and to those that love them
it is much to do and oh but there are rewards in that we can bestow such happiness
but the young ladies
he has no wife nor daughter and the young do not tell themselves to the young but to the old like me who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them
so my dear we will send him away to smoke the cigarette in the garden whiles you and i have little talk all to ourselves
i took the hint and strolled about and presently the professor came to the window and called me in
he looked grave but said i have made careful examination but there is no functional cause
with you i agree that there has been much blood lost it has been but is not
but the conditions of her are in no way anmic
i have asked her to send me her maid that i may ask just one or two question that so i may not chance to miss nothing
i know well what she will say
and yet there is cause there is always cause for everything
i must go back home and think
you must send to me the telegram every day and if there be cause i shall come again
the diseasefor not to be all well is a diseaseinterest me and the sweet young dear she interest me too
she charm me and for her if not for you or disease i come
as i tell you he would not say a word more even when we were alone
and so now art you know all i know
i shall keep stern watch
i trust your poor father is rallying
it must be a terrible thing to you my dear old fellow to be placed in such a position between two people who are both so dear to you
i know your idea of duty to your father and you are right to stick to it but if need be i shall send you word to come at once to lucy so do not be overanxious unless you hear from me
4 september
zophagous patient still keeps up our interest in him
he had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time
just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless
the attendant knew the symptoms and at once summoned aid
fortunately the men came at a run and were just in time for at the stroke of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him
in about five minutes however he began to get more and more quiet and finally sank into a sort of melancholy in which state he has remained up to now
the attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling i found my hands full when i got in attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him
indeed i can quite understand the effect for the sounds disturbed even me though i was some distance away
it is now after the dinnerhour of the asylum and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding with a dull sullen woebegone look in his face which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly
i cannot quite understand it
another change in my patient
at five oclock i looked in on him and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be
he was catching flies and eating them and was keeping note of his capture by making nailmarks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding
when he saw me he came over and apologised for his bad conduct and asked me in a very humble cringing way to be led back to his own room and to have his notebook again
i thought it well to humour him so he is back in his room with the window open
he has the sugar of his tea spread out on the windowsill and is reaping quite a harvest of flies
he is not now eating them but putting them into a box as of old and is already examining the corners of his room to find a spider
i tried to get him to talk about the past few days for any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me but he would not rise
for a moment or two he looked very sad and said in a sort of faraway voice as though saying it rather to himself than to me all over
all over
he has deserted me
no hope for me now unless i do it for myself
then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way he said doctor wont you be very good to me and let me have a little more sugar
i think it would be good for me
and the flies
the flies like it too and i like the flies therefore i like it
and there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do not argue
i procured him a double supply and left him as happy a man as i suppose any in the world
i wish i could fathom his mind
another change in him
i had been to see miss westenra whom i found much better and had just returned and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset when once more i heard him yelling
as his room is on this side of the house i could hear it better than in the morning
it was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over london with its lurid lights and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building with its wealth of breathing misery and my own desolate heart to endure it all
i reached him just as the sun was going down and from his window saw the red disc sink
as it sank he became less and less frenzied and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him an inert mass on the floor
it is wonderful however what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have for within a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around him
i signalled to the attendants not to hold him for i was anxious to see what he would do
he went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar then he took his flybox and emptied it outside and threw away the box then he shut the window and crossing over sat down on his bed
all this surprised me so i asked him are you not going to keep flies any more
no said he i am sick of all that rubbish
he certainly is a wonderfully interesting study
i wish i could get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of his sudden passion
stop there may be a clue after all if we can find why today his paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset
can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain naturesas at times the moon does others
we shall see
telegram seward london to van helsing amsterdam
patient still better today
5 september
patient greatly improved
good appetite sleeps naturally good spirits colour coming back
6 september
terrible change for the worse
come at once do not lose an hour
i hold over telegram to holmwood till have seen you
my dear art my news today is not so good
lucy this morning had gone back a bit
there is however one good thing which has arisen from it mr
westenra was naturally anxious concerning lucy and has consulted me professionally about her
i took advantage of the opportunity and told her that my old master van helsing the great specialist was coming to stay with me and that i would put her in his charge conjointly with myself so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly for a shock to her would mean sudden death and this in lucys weak condition might be disastrous to her
we are hedged in with difficulties all of us my poor old fellow but please god we shall come through them all right
if any need i shall write so that if you do not hear from me take it for granted that i am simply waiting for news
in haste yours ever john seward
7 september
the first thing van helsing said to me when we met at liverpool street was have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her
no i said
i waited till i had seen you as i said in my telegram
i wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming as miss westenra was not so well and that i should let him know if need be
right my friend he said quite right
better he not know as yet perhaps he shall never know
i pray so but if it be needed then he shall know all
and my good friend john let me caution you
you deal with the madmen
all men are mad in some way or the other and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen so deal with gods madmen toothe rest of the world
you tell not your madmen what you do nor why you do it you tell them not what you think
so you shall keep knowledge in its place where it may restwhere it may gather its kind around it and breed
you and i shall keep as yet what we know here and here
he touched me on the heart and on the forehead and then touched himself the same way
i have for myself thoughts at the present
later i shall unfold to you
why not now
i asked
it may do some good we may arrive at some decision
he stopped and looked at me and said my friend john when the corn is grown even before it has ripenedwhile the milk of its motherearth is in him and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands and blow away the green chaff and say to you look
hes good corn he will make good crop when the time comes
i did not see the application and told him so
for reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully as he used long ago to do at lectures and said the good husbandman tell you so then because he knows but not till then
but you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow that is for the children who play at husbandry and not for those who take it as of the work of their life
see you now friend john
i have sown my corn and nature has her work to do in making it sprout if he sprout at all theres some promise and i wait till the ear begins to swell
he broke off for he evidently saw that i understood
then he went on and very gravely you were always a careful student and your casebook was ever more full than the rest
you were only student then now you are master and i trust that good habit have not fail
remember my friend that knowledge is stronger than memory and we should not trust the weaker
even if you have not kept the good practise let me tell you that this case of our dear miss is one that may bemind i say may be of such interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the beam as your peoples say
take then good note of it
nothing is too small
i counsel you put down in record even your doubts and surmises
hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess
we learn from failure not from success
when i described lucys symptomsthe same as before but infinitely more markedhe looked very grave but said nothing
he took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade as he once called in one of his lectures the equipment of a professor of the healing craft
when we were shown in mr
westenra met us
she was alarmed but not nearly so much as i expected to find her
nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terrors
here in a case where any shock may prove fatal matters are so ordered that from some cause or other the things not personaleven the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attacheddo not seem to reach her
it is something like the way dame nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact
if this be an ordered selfishness then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of
i used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology and laid down a rule that she should not be present with lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required
she assented readily so readily that i saw again the hand of nature fighting for life
van helsing and i were shown up to lucys room
if i was shocked when i saw her yesterday i was horrified when i saw her today
she was ghastly chalkily pale the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums and the bones of her face stood out prominently her breathing was painful to see or hear
van helsings face grew set as marble and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose
lucy lay motionless and did not seem to have strength to speak so for a while we were all silent
then van helsing beckoned to me and we went gently out of the room
the instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door which was open
then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door
my god
he said this is dreadful
there is no time to be lost
she will die for sheer want of blood to keep the hearts action as it should be
there must be transfusion of blood at once
is it you or me
i am younger and stronger professor
it must be me
then get ready at once
i will bring up my bag
i am prepared
i went downstairs with him and as we were going there was a knock at the halldoor
when we reached the hall the maid had just opened the door and arthur was stepping quickly in
he rushed up to me saying in an eager whisper jack i was so anxious
i read between the lines of your letter and have been in an agony
the dad was better so i ran down here to see for myself
is not that gentleman dr van helsing
i am so thankful to you sir for coming
when first the professors eye had lit upon him he had been angry at his interruption at such a time but now as he took in his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him his eyes gleamed
without a pause he said to him gravely as he held out his hand sir you have come in time
you are the lover of our dear miss
she is bad very very bad
nay my child do not go like that
for he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting
you are to help her
you can do more than any that live and your courage is your best help
asked arthur hoarsely
tell me and i shall do it
my life is hers and i would give the last drop of blood in my body for her
the professor has a strongly humorous side and i could from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer my young sir i do not ask so much as thatnot the last
there was fire in his eyes and his open nostril quivered with intent
van helsing slapped him on the shoulder
he said
you are a man and it is a man we want
you are better than me better than my friend john
arthur looked bewildered and the professor went on by explaining in a kindly way young miss is bad very bad
she wants blood and blood she must have or die
my friend john and i have consulted and we are about to perform what we call transfusion of bloodto transfer from full veins of one to the empty veins which pine for him
john was to give his blood as he is the more young and strong than mehere arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in silencebut now you are here you are more good than us old or young who toil much in the world of thought
our nerves are not so calm and our blood not so bright than yours
arthur turned to him and said if you only knew how gladly i would die for her you would understand he stopped with a sort of choke in his voice
good boy
said van helsing
in the notsofaroff you will be happy that you have done all for her you love
come now and be silent
you shall kiss her once before it is done but then you must go and you must leave at my sign
say no word to madame you know how it is with her
there must be no shock any knowledge of this would be one
we all went up to lucys room
arthur by direction remained outside
lucy turned her head and looked at us but said nothing
she was not asleep but she was simply too weak to make the effort
her eyes spoke to us that was all
van helsing took some things from his bag and laid them on a little table out of sight
then he mixed a narcotic and coming over to the bed said cheerily now little miss here is your medicine
drink it off like a good child
see i lift you so that to swallow is easy
she had made the effort with success
it astonished me how long the drug took to act
this in fact marked the extent of her weakness
the time seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in her eyelids
at last however the narcotic began to manifest its potency and she fell into a deep sleep
when the professor was satisfied he called arthur into the room and bade him strip off his coat
then he added you may take that one little kiss whiles i bring over the table
friend john help to me
so neither of us looked whilst he bent over her
van helsing turning to me said he is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate it
then with swiftness but with absolute method van helsing performed the operation
as the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come back to poor lucys cheeks and through arthurs growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine
after a bit i began to grow anxious for the loss of blood was telling on arthur strong man as he was
it gave me an idea of what a terrible strain lucys system must have undergone that what weakened arthur only partially restored her
but the professors face was set and he stood watch in hand and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on arthur
i could hear my own heart beat
presently he said in a soft voice do not stir an instant
it is enough
you attend him i will look to her
when all was over i could see how much arthur was weakened
i dressed the wound and took his arm to bring him away when van helsing spoke without turning roundthe man seems to have eyes in the back of his head the brave lover i think deserve another kiss which he shall have presently
and as he had now finished his operation he adjusted the pillow to the patients head
as he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her was dragged a little up and showed a red mark on her throat
arthur did not notice it but i could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of van helsings ways of betraying emotion
he said nothing at the moment but turned to me saying now take down our brave young lover give him of the port wine and let him lie down a while
he must then go home and rest sleep much and eat much that he may be recruited of what he has so given to his love
he must not stay here
hold
a moment
i may take it sir that you are anxious of result
then bring it with you that in all ways the operation is successful
you have saved her life this time and you can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is
i shall tell her all when she is well she shall love you none the less for what you have done
when arthur had gone i went back to the room
lucy was sleeping gently but her breathing was stronger i could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved
by the bedside sat van helsing looking at her intently
the velvet band again covered the red mark
i asked the professor in a whisper what do you make of that mark on her throat
what do you make of it
i have not examined it yet i answered and then and there proceeded to loose the band
just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures not large but not wholesomelooking
there was no sign of disease but the edges were white and wornlooking as if by some trituration
it at once occurred to me that this wound or whatever it was might be the means of that manifest loss of blood but i abandoned the idea as soon as formed for such a thing could not be
the whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion
well said i i can make nothing of it
the professor stood up
i must go back to amsterdam tonight he said
there are books and things there which i want
you must remain here all the night and you must not let your sight pass from her
shall i have a nurse
we are the best nurses you and i
you keep watch all night see that she is well fed and that nothing disturbs her
you must not sleep all the night
later on we can sleep you and i
i shall be back as soon as possible
and then we may begin
may begin
what on earth do you mean
he answered as he hurried out
he came back a moment later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held up remember she is your charge
if you leave her and harm befall you shall not sleep easy hereafter
dr sewards diarycontinued
8 september
i sat up all night with lucy
the opiate worked itself off towards dusk and she waked naturally she looked a different being from what she had been before the operation
her spirits even were good and she was full of a happy vivacity but i could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone
when i told mr
westenra that dr van helsing had directed that i should sit up with her she almost poohpoohed the idea pointing out her daughters renewed strength and excellent spirits
i was firm however and made preparations for my long vigil
when her maid had prepared her for the night i came in having in the meantime had supper and took a seat by the bedside
she did not in any way make objection but looked at me gratefully whenever i caught her eye
after a long spell she seemed sinking off to sleep but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook it off
this was repeated several times with greater effort and with shorter pauses as the time moved on
it was apparent that she did not want to sleep so i tackled the subject at once you do not want to go to sleep
no i am afraid
afraid to go to sleep
why so
it is the boon we all crave for
ah not if you were like meif sleep was to you a presage of horror
a presage of horror
i dont know oh i dont know
and that is what is so terrible
all this weakness comes to me in sleep until i dread the very thought
but my dear girl you may sleep tonight
i am here watching you and i can promise that nothing will happen
ah i can trust you
i seized the opportunity and said i promise you that if i see any evidence of bad dreams i will wake you at once
you will
oh will you really
how good you are to me
then i will sleep
and almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief and sank back asleep
all night long i watched by her
she never stirred but slept on and on in a deep tranquil lifegiving healthgiving sleep
her lips were slightly parted and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum
there was a smile on her face and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind
in the early morning her maid came and i left her in her care and took myself back home for i was anxious about many things
i sent a short wire to van helsing and to arthur telling them of the excellent result of the operation
my own work with its manifold arrears took me all day to clear off it was dark when i was able to inquire about my zophagous patient
the report was good he had been quite quiet for the past day and night
a telegram came from van helsing at amsterdam whilst i was at dinner suggesting that i should be at hillingham tonight as it might be well to be at hand and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the morning
9 september
i was pretty tired and worn out when i got to hillingham
for two nights i had hardly had a wink of sleep and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion
lucy was up and in cheerful spirits
when she shook hands with me she looked sharply in my face and said no sitting up tonight for you
you are worn out
i am quite well again indeed i am and if there is to be any sitting up it is i who will sit up with you
i would not argue the point but went and had my supper
lucy came with me and enlivened by her charming presence i made an excellent meal and had a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port
then lucy took me upstairs and showed me a room next her own where a cozy fire was burning
now she said you must stay here
i shall leave this door open and my door too
you can lie on the sofa for i know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon
if i want anything i shall call out and you can come to me at once
i could not but acquiesce for i was dogtired and could not have sat up had i tried
so on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything i lay on the sofa and forgot all about everything
lucy westenras diary
i feel so happy tonight
i have been so miserably weak that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky
somehow arthur feels very very close to me
i seem to feel his presence warm about me
i suppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves whilst health and strength give love rein and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills
i know where my thoughts are
if arthur only knew
my dear my dear your ears must tingle as you sleep as mine do waking
oh the blissful rest of last night
how i slept with that dear good dr seward watching me
and tonight i shall not fear to sleep since he is close at hand and within call
thank everybody for being so good to me
thank god
goodnight arthur
10 september
i was conscious of the professors hand on my head and started awake all in a second
that is one of the things that we learn in an asylum at any rate
and how is our patient
well when i left her or rather when she left me i answered
come let us see he said
and together we went into the room
the blind was down and i went over to raise it gently whilst van helsing stepped with his soft catlike tread over to the bed
as i raised the blind and the morning sunlight flooded the room i heard the professors low hiss of inspiration and knowing its rarity a deadly fear shot through my heart
as i passed over he moved back and his exclamation of horror gott in himmel
needed no enforcement from his agonised face
he raised his hand and pointed to the bed and his iron face was drawn and ashen white
i felt my knees begin to tremble
there on the bed seemingly in a swoon lay poor lucy more horribly white and wanlooking than ever
even the lips were white and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness
van helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit stood to him and he put it down again softly
quick
bring the brandy
i flew to the diningroom and returned with the decanter
he wetted the poor white lips with it and together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart
he felt her heart and after a few moments of agonising suspense said it is not too late
it beats though but feebly
all our work is undone we must begin again
there is no young arthur here now i have to call on you yourself this time friend john
as he spoke he was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion i had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirtsleeve
there was no possibility of an opiate just at present and no need of one and so without a moments delay we began the operation
after a timeit did not seem a short time either for the draining away of ones blood no matter how willingly it be given is a terrible feelingvan helsing held up a warning finger
do not stir he said but i fear that with growing strength she may wake and that would make danger oh so much danger
but i shall precaution take
i shall give hypodermic injection of morphia
he proceeded then swiftly and deftly to carry out his intent
the effect on lucy was not bad for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep
it was with a feeling of personal pride that i could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips
no man knows till he experiences it what it is to feel his own lifeblood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves
the professor watched me critically
that will do he said
already
i remonstrated
you took a great deal more from art
to which he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied he is her lover her fianc
you have work much work to do for her and for others and the present will suffice
when we stopped the operation he attended to lucy whilst i applied digital pressure to my own incision
i laid down whilst i waited his leisure to attend to me for i felt faint and a little sick
byandby he bound up my wound and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself
as i was leaving the room he came after me and half whispered mind nothing must be said of this
if our young lover should turn up unexpected as before no word to him
it would at once frighten him and enjealous him too
there must be none
when i came back he looked at me carefully and then said you are not much the worse
go into the room and lie on your sofa and rest awhile then have much breakfast and come here to me
i followed out his orders for i knew how right and wise they were
i had done my part and now my next duty was to keep up my strength
i felt very weak and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred
i fell asleep on the sofa however wondering over and over again how lucy had made such a retrograde movement and how she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it
i think i must have continued my wonder in my dreams for sleeping and waking my thoughts always came back to the little punctures in her throat and the ragged exhausted appearance of their edgestiny though they were
lucy slept well into the day and when she woke she was fairly well and strong though not nearly so much so as the day before
when van helsing had seen her he went out for a walk leaving me in charge with strict injunctions that i was not to leave her for a moment
i could hear his voice in the hall asking the way to the nearest telegraph office
lucy chatted with me freely and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened
i tried to keep her amused and interested
when her mother came up to see her she did not seem to notice any change whatever but said to me gratefully we owe you so much dr seward for all you have done but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself
you are looking pale yourself
you want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit that you do
as she spoke lucy turned crimson though it was only momentarily for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted drain to the head
the reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me
i smiled and nodded and laid my finger on my lips with a sigh she sank back amid her pillows
van helsing returned in a couple of hours and presently said to me now you go home and eat much and drink enough
make yourself strong
i stay here tonight and i shall sit up with little miss myself
you and i must watch the case and we must have none other to know
i have grave reasons
no do not ask them think what you will
do not fear to think even the most notprobable
in the hall two of the maids came to me and asked if they or either of them might not sit up with miss lucy
they implored me to let them and when i said it was dr van helsings wish that either he or i should sit up they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the foreign gentleman
i was much touched by their kindness
perhaps it is because i am weak at present and perhaps because it was on lucys account that their devotion was manifested for over and over again have i seen similar instances of womans kindness
i got back here in time for a late dinner went my roundsall well and set this down whilst waiting for sleep
it is coming
11 september
this afternoon i went over to hillingham
found van helsing in excellent spirits and lucy much better
shortly after i had arrived a big parcel from abroad came for the professor
he opened it with much impressmentassumed of courseand showed a great bundle of white flowers
these are for you miss lucy he said
oh dr van helsing
yes my dear but not for you to play with
these are medicines
here lucy made a wry face
nay but they are not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form so you need not snub that so charming nose or i shall point out to my friend arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that he so loves so much distort
aha my pretty miss that bring the so nice nose all straight again
this is medicinal but you do not know how
i put him in your window i make pretty wreath and hang him round your neck so that you sleep well
they like the lotus flower make your trouble forgotten
it smell so like the waters of lethe and of that fountain of youth that the conquistadores sought for in the floridas and find him all too late
whilst he was speaking lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them
now she threw them down saying with halflaughter and halfdisgust oh professor i believe you are only putting up a joke on me
why these flowers are only common garlic
to my surprise van helsing rose up and said with all his sternness his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting no trifling with me
i never jest
there is grim purpose in all i do and i warn you that you do not thwart me
take care for the sake of others if not for your own
then seeing poor lucy scared as she might well be he went on more gently oh little miss my dear do not fear me
i only do for your good but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers
see i place them myself in your room
i make myself the wreath that you are to wear
but hush
no telling to others that make so inquisitive questions
we must obey and silence is a part of obedience and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you
now sit still awhile
come with me friend john and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic which is all the way from haarlem where my friend vanderpool raise herb in his glasshouses all the year
i had to telegraph yesterday or they would not have been here
we went into the room taking the flowers with us
the professors actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia that i ever heard of
first he fastened up the windows and latched them securely next taking a handful of the flowers he rubbed them all over the sashes as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell
then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door above below and at each side and round the fireplace in the same way
it all seemed grotesque to me and presently i said well professor i know you always have a reason for what you do but this certainly puzzles me
it is well we have no sceptic here or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit
perhaps i am
he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which lucy was to wear round her neck
we then waited whilst lucy made her toilet for the night and when she was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck
the last words he said to her were take care you do not disturb it and even if the room feel close do not tonight open the window or the door
i promise said lucy and thank you both a thousand times for all your kindness to me
oh what have i done to be blessed with such friends
as we left the house in my fly which was waiting van helsing said tonight i can sleep in peace and sleep i wanttwo nights of travel much reading in the day between and much anxiety on the day to follow and a night to sit up without to wink
tomorrow in the morning early you call for me and we come together to see our pretty miss so much more strong for my spell which i have work
ho
he seemed so confident that i remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result felt awe and vague terror
it must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend but i felt it all the more like unshed tears
12 september
how good they all are to me
i quite love that dear dr van helsing
i wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers
he positively frightened me he was so fierce
and yet he must have been right for i feel comfort from them already
somehow i do not dread being alone tonight and i can go to sleep without fear
i shall not mind any flapping outside the window
oh the terrible struggle that i have had against sleep so often of late the pain of the sleeplessness or the pain of the fear of sleep with such unknown horrors as it has for me
how blessed are some people whose lives have no fears no dreads to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly and brings nothing but sweet dreams
well here i am tonight hoping for sleep and lying like ophelia in the play with virgin crants and maiden strewments
i never liked garlic before but tonight it is delightful
there is peace in its smell i feel sleep coming already
goodnight everybody
13 september
called at the berkeley and found van helsing as usual up to time
the carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting
the professor took his bag which he always brings with him now
let all be put down exactly
van helsing and i arrived at hillingham at eight oclock
it was a lovely morning the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of natures annual work
the leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours but had not yet begun to drop from the trees
when we entered we met mr
westenra coming out of the morning room
she is always an early riser
she greeted us warmly and said you will be glad to know that lucy is better
the dear child is still asleep
i looked into her room and saw her but did not go in lest i should disturb her
the professor smiled and looked quite jubilant
he rubbed his hands together and said aha
i thought i had diagnosed the case
my treatment is working to which she answered you must not take all the credit to yourself doctor
lucys state this morning is due in part to me
how you do mean maam
asked the professor
well i was anxious about the dear child in the night and went into her room
she was sleeping soundlyso soundly that even my coming did not wake her
but the room was awfully stuffy
there were a lot of those horrible strongsmelling flowers about everywhere and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck
i feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in her weak state so i took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air
you will be pleased with her i am sure
she moved off into her boudoir where she usually breakfasted early
as she had spoken i watched the professors face and saw it turn ashen grey
he had been able to retain his selfcommand whilst the poor lady was present for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room
but the instant she had disappeared he pulled me suddenly and forcibly into the diningroom and closed the door
then for the first time in my life i saw van helsing break down
he raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair and then beat his palms together in a helpless way finally he sat down on a chair and putting his hands before his face began to sob with loud dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart
then he raised his arms again as though appealing to the whole universe
god
what have we done what has this poor thing done that we are so sore beset
is there fate amongst us still sent down from the pagan world of old that such things must be and in such way
this poor mother all unknowing and all for the best as she think does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul and we must not tell her we must not even warn her or she die and then both die
oh how we are beset
how are all the powers of the devils against us
suddenly he jumped to his feet
come he said come we must see and act
devils or no devils or all the devils at once it matters not we fight him all the same
he went to the halldoor for his bag and together we went up to lucys room
once again i drew up the blind whilst van helsing went towards the bed
this time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same awful waxen pallor as before
he wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity
as i expected he murmured with that hissing inspiration of his which meant so much
without a word he went and locked the door and then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another operation of transfusion of blood
i had long ago recognised the necessity and begun to take off my coat but he stopped me with a warning hand
today you must operate
i shall provide
you are weakened already
as he spoke he took off his coat and rolled up his shirtsleeve
again the operation again the narcotic again some return of colour to the ashy cheeks and the regular breathing of healthy sleep
this time i watched whilst van helsing recruited himself and rested
presently he took an opportunity of telling mr
westenra that she must not remove anything from lucys room without consulting him that the flowers were of medicinal value and that the breathing of their odour was a part of the system of cure
then he took over the care of the case himself saying that he would watch this night and the next and would send me word when to come
after another hour lucy waked from her sleep fresh and bright and seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal
what does it all mean
i am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain
17 september
four days and nights of peace
i am getting so strong again that i hardly know myself
it is as if i had passed through some long nightmare and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me
i have a dim halfremembrance of long anxious times of waiting and fearing darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant and then long spells of oblivion and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water
since however dr van helsing has been with me all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away the noises that used to frighten me out of my witsthe flapping against the windows the distant voices which seemed so close to me the harsh sounds that came from i know not where and commanded me to do i know not whathave all ceased
i go to bed now without any fear of sleep
i do not even try to keep awake
i have grown quite fond of the garlic and a boxful arrives for me every day from haarlem
tonight dr van helsing is going away as he has to be for a day in amsterdam
but i need not be watched i am well enough to be left alone
thank god for mothers sake and dear arthurs and for all our friends who have been so kind
i shall not even feel the change for last night dr van helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time
i found him asleep twice when i awoke but i did not fear to go to sleep again although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against the windowpanes
the pall mall gazette 18 september
the escaped wolf
perilous adventure of our interviewer
interview with the keeper in the zological gardens
after many inquiries and almost as many refusals and perpetually using the words pall mall gazette as a sort of talisman i managed to find the keeper of the section of the zological gardens in which the wolf department is included
thomas bilder lives in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephanthouse and was just sitting down to his tea when i found him
thomas and his wife are hospitable folk elderly and without children and if the specimen i enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind their lives must be pretty comfortable
the keeper would not enter on what he called business until the supper was over and we were all satisfied
then when the table was cleared and he had lit his pipe he said now sir you can go on and arsk me what you want
youll excoose me refoosin to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals
i gives the wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore i begins to arsk them questions
how do you mean ask them questions
i queried wishful to get him into a talkative humour
ittin of them over the ead with a pole is one way scratchin of their hears is another when gents as is flush wants a bit of a showorf to their gals
i dont so much mind the fustthe ittin with a pole afore i chucks in their dinner but i waits till theyve ad their sherry and kawffee so to speak afore i tries on with the earscratchin
mind you he added philosophically theres a deal of the same nature in us as in them theer animiles
heres you acomin and arskin of me questions about my business and i that grumpylike that only for your bloomin arfquid id a seen you blowed fust fore id answer
not even when you arsked me sarcasticlike if id like you to arsk the superintendent if you might arsk me questions
without offence did i tell yer to go to ell
you did
an when you said youd report me for usin of obscene language that was ittin me over the ead but the arfquid made that all right
i werent agoin to fight so i waited for the food and did with my owl as the wolves and lions and tigers does
but lor love yer art now that the old ooman has stuck a chunk of her teacake in me an rinsed me out with her bloomin old teapot and ive lit hup you may scratch my ears for all youre worth and wont git even a growl out of me
drive along with your questions
i know what yer acomin at that ere escaped wolf
exactly
i want you to give me your view of it
just tell me how it happened and when i know the facts ill get you to say what you consider was the cause of it and how you think the whole affair will end
all right guvnor
this ere is about the ole story
that ere wolf what we called bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from norway to jamrchs which we bought off him four years ago
he was a nice wellbehaved wolf that never gave no trouble to talk of
im more surprised at im for wantin to get out nor any other animile in the place
but there you cant trust wolves no more nor women
dont you mind him sir
broke in mr
tom with a cheery laugh
es got mindin the animiles so long that blest if he aint like a old wolf isself
but there aint no arm in im
well sir it was about two hours after feedin yesterday when i first hear my disturbance
i was makin up a litter in the monkeyhouse for a young puma which is ill but when i heard the yelpin and owlin i kem away straight
there was bersicker atearin like a mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out
there wasnt much people about that day and close at hand was only one man a tall thin chap with a ook nose and a pointed beard with a few white hairs runnin through it
he had a ard cold look and red eyes and i took a sort of mislike to him for it seemed as if it was im as they was hirritated at
he ad white kid gloves on is ands and he pointed out the animiles to me and says keeper these wolves seem upset at something
maybe its you says i for i did not like the airs as he give isself
he didnt git angry as i oped he would but he smiled a kind of insolent smile with a mouth full of white sharp teeth
oh no they wouldnt like me e says
ow yes they would says i aimitatin of him
they always likes a bone or two to clean their teeth on about teatime which you as a bagful
well it was a odd thing but when the animiles see us atalkin they lay down and when i went over to bersicker he let me stroke his ears same as ever
that there man kem over and blessed but if he didnt put in his hand and stroke the old wolfs ears too
tyke care says i
bersicker is quick
never mind he says
im used to em
are you in the business yourself
i says tyking off my at for a man what trades in wolves anceterer is a good friend to keepers
no says he not exactly in the business but i ave made pets of several
and with that he lifts his at as perlite as a lord and walks away
old bersicker kep alookin arter im till e was out of sight and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldnt come hout the ole hevening
well larst night so soon as the moon was hup the wolves here all began aowling
there warnt nothing for them to owl at
there warnt no one near except some one that was evidently acallin a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the park road
once or twice i went out to see that all was right and it was and then the owling stopped
just before twelve oclock i just took a look round afore turnin in an bust me but when i kem opposite to old bersickers cage i see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty
and thats all i know for certing
did any one else see anything
one of our gardners was acomin ome about that time from a armony when he sees a big grey dog comin out through the garding edges
at least so he says but i dont give much for it myself for if he did e never said a word about it to his missis when e got ome and it was only after the escape of the wolf was made known and we had been up all nightahuntin of the park for bersicker that he remembered seein anything
my own belief was that the armony ad got into his ead
now mr bilder can you account in any way for the escape of the wolf
well sir he said with a suspicious sort of modesty i think i can but i dont know as ow youd be satisfied with the theory
certainly i shall
if a man like you who knows the animals from experience cant hazard a good guess at any rate who is even to try
well then sir i accounts for it this way it seems to me that ere wolf escapedsimply because he wanted to get out
from the hearty way that both thomas and his wife laughed at the joke i could see that it had done service before and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell
i couldnt cope in badinage with the worthy thomas but i thought i knew a surer way to his heart so i said now mr bilder well consider that first halfsovereign worked off and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when youve told me what you think will happen
right yare sir he said briskly
yell excoose me i know for achaffin of ye but the old woman here winked at me which was as much as telling me to go on
well i never
said the old lady
my opinion is this that ere wolf is aidin of somewheres
the gardner wot didnt remember said he was agallopin northward faster than a horse could go but i dont believe him for yer see sir wolves dont gallop no more nor dogs does they not bein built that way
wolves is fine things in a storybook and i dessay when they gets in packs and does be chivyin somethin thats more afeared than they is they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up whatever it is
but lor bless you in real life a wolf is only a low creature not half so clever or bold as a good dog and not half a quarter so much fight in im
this one aint been used to fightin or even to providin for hisself and more like hes somewhere round the park aidin an ashiverin of and if he thinks at all wonderin where he is to get his breakfast from or maybe hes got down some area and is in a coalcellar
my eye wont some cook get a rum start when she sees his green eyes ashining at her out of the dark
if he cant get food hes bound to look for it and mayhap he may chance to light on a butchers shop in time
if he doesnt and some nursemaid goes awalkin orf with a soldier leavin of the hinfant in the perambulatorwell then i shouldnt be surprised if the census is one babby the less
thats all
i was handing him the halfsovereign when something came bobbing up against the window and mr bilders face doubled its natural length with surprise
god bless me
if there aint old bersicker come back by isself
he went to the door and opened it a most unnecessary proceeding it seemed to me
i have always thought that a wild animal never looks so well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us a personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea
after all however there is nothing like custom for neither bilder nor his wife thought any more of the wolf than i should of a dog
the animal itself was as peaceful and wellbehaved as that father of all picturewolvesred riding hoods quondam friend whilst moving her confidence in masquerade
the whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos
the wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed london and set all the children in the town shivering in their shoes was there in a sort of penitent mood and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal son
old bilder examined him all over with most tender solicitude and when he had finished with his penitent said there i knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble didnt i say it all along
heres his head all cut and full of broken glass
es been agettin over some bloomin wall or other
its a shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles
this eres what comes of it
come along bersicker
he took the wolf and locked him up in a cage with a piece of meat that satisfied in quantity at any rate the elementary conditions of the fatted calf and went off to report
i came off too to report the only exclusive information that is given today regarding the strange escapade at the zoo
i was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my books which through press of other work and the many visits to lucy had fallen sadly into arrear
suddenly the door was burst open and in rushed my patient with his face distorted with passion
i was thunderstruck for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord into the superintendents study is almost unknown
without an instants pause he made straight at me
he had a dinnerknife in his hand and as i saw he was dangerous i tried to keep the table between us
he was too quick and too strong for me however for before i could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely
before he could strike again however i got in my right and he was sprawling on his back on the floor
my wrist bled freely and quite a little pool trickled on to the carpet
i saw that my friend was not intent on further effort and occupied myself binding up my wrist keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time
when the attendants rushed in and we turned our attention to him his employment positively sickened me
he was lying on his belly on the floor licking up like a dog the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist
he was easily secured and to my surprise went with the attendants quite placidly simply repeating over and over again the blood is the life
the blood is the life
i cannot afford to lose blood just at present i have lost too much of late for my physical good and then the prolonged strain of lucys illness and its horrible phases is telling on me
i am overexcited and weary and i need rest rest rest
happily van helsing has not summoned me so i need not forego my sleep tonight i could not well do without it
telegram van helsing antwerp to seward carfax
sent to carfax sussex as no county given delivered late by twentytwo hours
do not fail to be at hillingham tonight
if not watching all the time frequently visit and see that flowers are as placed very important do not fail
shall be with you as soon as possible after arrival
18 september
just off for train to london
the arrival of van helsings telegram filled me with dismay
a whole night lost and i know by bitter experience what may happen in a night
of course it is possible that all may be well but what may have happened
surely there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident should thwart us in all we try to do
i shall take this cylinder with me and then i can complete my entry on lucys phonograph
memorandum left by lucy westenra
night
i write this and leave it to be seen so that no one may by any chance get into trouble through me
this is an exact record of what took place tonight
i feel i am dying of weakness and have barely strength to write but it must be done if i die in the doing
i went to bed as usual taking care that the flowers were placed as dr van helsing directed and soon fell asleep
i was waked by the flapping at the window which had begun after that sleepwalking on the cliff at whitby when mina saved me and which now i know so well
i was not afraid but i did wish that dr seward was in the next roomas dr van helsing said he would beso that i might have called him
i tried to go to sleep but could not
then there came to me the old fear of sleep and i determined to keep awake
perversely sleep would try to come then when i did not want it so as i feared to be alone i opened my door and called out is there anybody there
there was no answer
i was afraid to wake mother and so closed my door again
then outside in the shrubbery i heard a sort of howl like a dogs but more fierce and deeper
i went to the window and looked out but could see nothing except a big bat which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window
so i went back to bed again but determined not to go to sleep
presently the door opened and mother looked in seeing by my moving that i was not asleep came in and sat by me
she said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont i was uneasy about you darling and came in to see that you were all right
i feared she might catch cold sitting there and asked her to come in and sleep with me so she came into bed and lay down beside me she did not take off her dressing gown for she said she would only stay a while and then go back to her own bed
as she lay there in my arms and i in hers the flapping and buffeting came to the window again
she was startled and a little frightened and cried out what is that
i tried to pacify her and at last succeeded and she lay quiet but i could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly
after a while there was the low howl again out in the shrubbery and shortly after there was a crash at the window and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor
the window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great gaunt grey wolf
mother cried out in a fright and struggled up into a sitting posture and clutched wildly at anything that would help her
amongst other things she clutched the wreath of flowers that dr van helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck and tore it away from me
for a second or two she sat up pointing at the wolf and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat then she fell overas if struck with lightning and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two
the room and all round seemed to spin round
i kept my eyes fixed on the window but the wolf drew his head back and a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert
i tried to stir but there was some spell upon me and dear mothers poor body which seemed to grow cold alreadyfor her dear heart had ceased to beatweighed me down and i remembered no more for a while
the time did not seem long but very very awful till i recovered consciousness again
somewhere near a passing bell was tolling the dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling and in our shrubbery seemingly just outside a nightingale was singing
i was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort me
the sounds seemed to have awakened the maids too for i could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door
i called to them and they came in and when they saw what had happened and what it was that lay over me on the bed they screamed out
the wind rushed in through the broken window and the door slammed to
they lifted off the body of my dear mother and laid her covered up with a sheet on the bed after i had got up
they were all so frightened and nervous that i directed them to go to the diningroom and have each a glass of wine
the door flew open for an instant and closed again
the maids shrieked and then went in a body to the diningroom and i laid what flowers i had on my dear mothers breast
when they were there i remembered what dr van helsing had told me but i didnt like to remove them and besides i would have some of the servants to sit up with me now
i was surprised that the maids did not come back
i called them but got no answer so i went to the diningroom to look for them
my heart sank when i saw what had happened
they all four lay helpless on the floor breathing heavily
the decanter of sherry was on the table half full but there was a queer acrid smell about
i was suspicious and examined the decanter
it smelt of laudanum and looking on the sideboard i found that the bottle which mothers doctor uses for heroh
did usewas empty
what am i to do
i am back in the room with mother
i cannot leave her and i am alone save for the sleeping servants whom some one has drugged
alone with the dead
i dare not go out for i can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken window
the air seems full of specks floating and circling in the draught from the window and the lights burn blue and dim
god shield me from harm this night
i shall hide this paper in my breast where they shall find it when they come to lay me out
my dear mother gone
it is time that i go too
goodbye dear arthur if i should not survive this night
god keep you dear and god help me
i drove at once to hillingham and arrived early
keeping my cab at the gate i went up the avenue alone
i knocked gently and rang as quietly as possible for i feared to disturb lucy or her mother and hoped to only bring a servant to the door
after a while finding no response i knocked and rang again still no answer
i cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an hourfor it was now ten oclockand so rang and knocked again but more impatiently but still without response
hitherto i had blamed only the servants but now a terrible fear began to assail me
was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight around us
was it indeed a house of death to which i had come too late
i knew that minutes even seconds of delay might mean hours of danger to lucy if she had had again one of those frightful relapses and i went round the house to try if i could find by chance an entry anywhere
i could find no means of ingress
every window and door was fastened and locked and i returned baffled to the porch
as i did so i heard the rapid pitpat of a swiftly driven horses feet
they stopped at the gate and a few seconds later i met van helsing running up the avenue
when he saw me he gasped out then it was you and just arrived
how is she
are we too late
did you not get my telegram
i answered as quickly and coherently as i could that i had only got his telegram early in the morning and had not lost a minute in coming here and that i could not make any one in the house hear me
he paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly then i fear we are too late
gods will be done
with his usual recuperative energy he went on come
if there be no way open to get in we must make one
time is all in all to us now
we went round to the back of the house where there was a kitchen window
the professor took a small surgical saw from his case and handing it to me pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window
i attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them
then with a long thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window
i helped the professor in and followed him
there was no one in the kitchen or in the servants rooms which were close at hand
we tried all the rooms as we went along and in the diningroom dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters found four servantwomen lying on the floor
there was no need to think them dead for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition
van helsing and i looked at each other and as we moved away he said we can attend to them later
then we ascended to lucys room
for an instant or two we paused at the door to listen but there was no sound that we could hear
with white faces and trembling hands we opened the door gently and entered the room
how shall i describe what we saw
on the bed lay two women lucy and her mother
the latter lay farthest in and she was covered with a white sheet the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the broken window showing the drawn white face with a look of terror fixed upon it
by her side lay lucy with face white and still more drawn
the flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her mothers bosom and her throat was bare showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before but looking horribly white and mangled
without a word the professor bent over the bed his head almost touching poor lucys breast then he gave a quick turn of his head as of one who listens and leaping to his feet he cried out to me it is not yet too late
i flew downstairs and returned with it taking care to smell and taste it lest it too were drugged like the decanter of sherry which i found on the table
the maids were still breathing but more restlessly and i fancied that the narcotic was wearing off
i did not stay to make sure but returned to van helsing
he rubbed the brandy as on another occasion on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands
he said to me i can do this all that can be at the present
you go wake those maids
flick them in the face with a wet towel and flick them hard
make them get heat and fire and a warm bath
this poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her
she will need be heated before we can do anything more
i went at once and found little difficulty in waking three of the women
the fourth was only a young girl and the drug had evidently affected her more strongly so i lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep
the others were dazed at first but as remembrance came back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner
i was stern with them however and would not let them talk
i told them that one life was bad enough to lose and that if they delayed they would sacrifice miss lucy
so sobbing and crying they went about their way half clad as they were and prepared fire and water
fortunately the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive and there was no lack of hot water
we got a bath and carried lucy out as she was and placed her in it
whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door
one of the maids ran off hurried on some more clothes and opened it
then she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from mr holmwood
i bade her simply tell him that he must wait for we could see no one now
she went away with the message and engrossed with our work i clean forgot all about him
i never saw in all my experience the professor work in such deadly earnest
i knewas he knewthat it was a standup fight with death and in a pause told him so
he answered me in a way that i did not understand but with the sternest look that his face could wear if that were all i would stop here where we are now and let her fade away into peace for i see no light in life over her horizon
he went on with his work with if possible renewed and more frenzied vigour
presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be of some effect
lucys heart beat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope and her lungs had a perceptible movement
van helsings face almost beamed and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me the first gain is ours
check to the king
we took lucy into another room which had by now been prepared and laid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat
i noticed that van helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat
she was still unconscious and was quite as bad as if not worse than we had ever seen her
van helsing called in one of the women and told her to stay with her and not to take her eyes off her till we returned and then beckoned me out of the room
we must consult as to what is to be done he said as we descended the stairs
in the hall he opened the diningroom door and we passed in he closing the door carefully behind him
the shutters had been opened but the blinds were already down with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the british woman of the lower classes always rigidly observes
the room was therefore dimly dark
it was however light enough for our purposes
van helsings sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity
he was evidently torturing his mind about something so i waited for an instant and he spoke what are we to do now
where are we to turn for help
we must have another transfusion of blood and that soon or that poor girls life wont be worth an hours purchase
you are exhausted already i am exhausted too
i fear to trust those women even if they would have courage to submit
what are we to do for some one who will open his veins for her
whats the matter with me anyhow
the voice came from the sofa across the room and its tones brought relief and joy to my heart for they were those of quincey morris
van helsing started angrily at the first sound but his face softened and a glad look came into his eyes as i cried out quincey morris
and rushed towards him with outstretched hands
what brought you here
i cried as our hands met
i guess art is the cause
he handed me a telegram have not heard from seward for three days and am terribly anxious
cannot leave
father still in same condition
send me word how lucy is
do not delay
holmwood
i think i came just in the nick of time
you know you have only to tell me what to do
van helsing strode forward and took his hand looking him straight in the eyes as he said a brave mans blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble
youre a man and no mistake
well the devil may work against us for all hes worth but god sends us men when we want them
once again we went through that ghastly operation
i have not the heart to go through with the details
lucy had got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before for though plenty of blood went into her veins her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions
her struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear
however the action of both heart and lungs improved and van helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia as before and with good effect
her faint became a profound slumber
the professor watched whilst i went downstairs with quincey morris and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting
i left quincey lying down after having a glass of wine and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast
then a thought struck me and i went back to the room where lucy now was
when i came softly in i found van helsing with a sheet or two of notepaper in his hand
he had evidently read it and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow
there was a look of grim satisfaction in his face as of one who has had a doubt solved
he handed me the paper saying only it dropped from lucys breast when we carried her to the bath
when i had read it i stood looking at the professor and after a pause asked him in gods name what does it all mean
was she or is she mad or what sort of horrible danger is it
i was so bewildered that i did not know what to say more
van helsing put out his hand and took the paper saying do not trouble about it now
forget it for the present
you shall know and understand it all in good time but it will be later
and now what is it that you came to me to say
this brought me back to fact and i was all myself again
i came to speak about the certificate of death
if we do not act properly and wisely there may be an inquest and that paper would have to be produced
i am in hopes that we need have no inquest for if we had it would surely kill poor lucy if nothing else did
i know and you know and the other doctor who attended her knows that mr
westenra had disease of the heart and we can certify that she died of it
let us fill up the certificate at once and i shall take it myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker
good oh my friend john
well thought of
truly miss lucy if she be sad in the foes that beset her is at least happy in the friends that love her
one two three all open their veins for her besides one old man
ah yes i know friend john i am not blind
i love you all the more for it
in the hall i met quincey morris with a telegram for arthur telling him that mr
westenra was dead that lucy also had been ill but was now going on better and that van helsing and i were with her
i told him where i was going and he hurried me out but as i was going said when you come back jack may i have two words with you all to ourselves
i nodded in reply and went out
i found no difficulty about the registration and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements
when i got back quincey was waiting for me
i told him i would see him as soon as i knew about lucy and went up to her room
she was still sleeping and the professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her side
from his putting his finger to his lips i gathered that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature
so i went down to quincey and took him into the breakfastroom where the blinds were not drawn down and which was a little more cheerful or rather less cheerless than the other rooms
when we were alone he said to me jack seward i dont want to shove myself in anywhere where ive no right to be but this is no ordinary case
you know i loved that girl and wanted to marry her but although thats all past and gone i cant help feeling anxious about her all the same
what is it thats wrong with her
the dutchmanand a fine old fellow he is i can see thatsaid that time you two came into the room that you must have another transfusion of blood and that both you and he were exhausted
now i know well that you medical men speak in camera and that a man must not expect to know what they consult about in private
but this is no common matter and whatever it is i have done my part
is not that so
thats so i said and he went on i take it that both you and van helsing had done already what i did today
thats so
and i guess art was in it too
when i saw him four days ago down at his own place he looked queer
i have not seen anything pulled down so quick since i was on the pampas and had a mare that i was fond of go to grass all in a night
one of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her in the night and what with his gorge and the vein left open there wasnt enough blood in her to let her stand up and i had to put a bullet through her as she lay
jack if you may tell me without betraying confidence arthur was the first is not that so
as he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious
he was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain
his very heart was bleeding and it took all the manhood of himand there was a royal lot of it tooto keep him from breaking down
i paused before answering for i felt that i must not betray anything which the professor wished kept secret but already he knew so much and guessed so much that there could be no reason for not answering so i answered in the same phrase thats so
and how long has this been going on
about ten days
ten days
then i guess jack seward that that poor pretty creature that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood of four strong men
man alive her whole body wouldnt hold it
then coming close to me he spoke in a fierce halfwhisper what took it out
i shook my head
that i said is the crux
van helsing is simply frantic about it and i am at my wits end
i cant even hazard a guess
there has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out all our calculations as to lucy being properly watched
but these shall not occur again
here we stay until all be wellor ill
quincey held out his hand
count me in he said
you and the dutchman will tell me what to do and ill do it
when she woke late in the afternoon lucys first movement was to feel in her breast and to my surprise produced the paper which van helsing had given me to read
the careful professor had replaced it where it had come from lest on waking she should be alarmed
her eye then lit on van helsing and on me too and gladdened
then she looked around the room and seeing where she was shuddered she gave a loud cry and put her poor thin hands before her pale face
we both understood what that meantthat she had realised to the full her mothers death so we tried what we could to comfort her
doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat but she was very low in thought and spirit and wept silently and weakly for a long time
we told her that either or both of us would now remain with her all the time and that seemed to comfort her
towards dusk she fell into a doze
here a very odd thing occurred
whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two
van helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her
all the same however she went on with the action of tearing as though the material were still in her hands finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments
van helsing seemed surprised and his brows gathered as if in thought but he said nothing
19 september
all last night she slept fitfully being always afraid to sleep and something weaker when she woke from it
the professor and i took it in turns to watch and we never left her for a moment unattended
quincey morris said nothing about his intention but i knew that all night long he patrolled round and round the house
when the day came its searching light showed the ravages in poor lucys strength
she was hardly able to turn her head and the little nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good
at times she slept and both van helsing and i noticed the difference in her between sleeping and waking
whilst asleep she looked stronger although more haggard and her breathing was softer her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth which thus looked positively longer and sharper than usual when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently changed the expression for she looked her own self although a dying one
in the afternoon she asked for arthur and we telegraphed for him
quincey went off to meet him at the station
when he arrived it was nearly six oclock and the sun was setting full and warm and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks
when he saw her arthur was simply choking with emotion and none of us could speak
in the hours that had passed the fits of sleep or the comatose condition that passed for it had grown more frequent so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened
arthurs presence however seemed to act as a stimulant she rallied a little and spoke to him more brightly than she had done since we arrived
he too pulled himself together and spoke as cheerily as he could so that the best was made of everything
it was now nearly one oclock and he and van helsing are sitting with her
i am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour and i am entering this on lucys phonograph
until six oclock they are to try to rest
i fear that tomorrow will end our watching for the shock has been too great the poor child cannot rally
god help us all
letter mina harker to lucy westenra
unopened by her
my dearest lucy it seems an age since i heard from you or indeed since i wrote
you will pardon me i know for all my faults when you have read all my budget of news
well i got my husband back all right when we arrived at exeter there was a carriage waiting for us and in it though he had an attack of gout mr hawkins
he took us to his house where there were rooms for us all nice and comfortable and we dined together
after dinner mr hawkins said my dears i want to drink your health and prosperity and may every blessing attend you both
i know you both from children and have with love and pride seen you grow up
now i want you to make your home here with me
i have left to me neither chick nor child all are gone and in my will i have left you everything
i cried lucy dear as jonathan and the old man clasped hands
our evening was a very very happy one
so here we are installed in this beautiful old house and from both my bedroom and the drawingroom i can see the great elms of the cathedral close with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral and i can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and gossiping all day after the manner of rooksand humans
i am busy i need not tell you arranging things and housekeeping
jonathan and mr hawkins are busy all day for now that jonathan is a partner mr hawkins wants to tell him all about the clients
how is your dear mother getting on
i wish i could run up to town for a day or two to see you dear but i dare not go yet with so much on my shoulders and jonathan wants looking after still
he is beginning to put some flesh on his bones again but he was terribly weakened by the long illness even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden way and awakes all trembling until i can coax him back to his usual placidity
however thank god these occasions grow less frequent as the days go on and they will in time pass away altogether i trust
and now i have told you my news let me ask yours
when are you to be married and where and who is to perform the ceremony and what are you to wear and is it to be a public or a private wedding
tell me all about it dear tell me all about everything for there is nothing which interests you which will not be dear to me
jonathan asks me to send his respectful duty but i do not think that is good enough from the junior partner of the important firm hawkins & harker and so as you love me and he loves me and i love you with all the moods and tenses of the verb i send you simply his love instead
goodbye my dearest lucy and all blessings on you
yours mina harker
report from patrick hennessey m

to john seward m
20 september
my dear sir in accordance with your wishes i enclose report of the conditions of everything left in my charge
with regard to patient renfield there is more to say
he has had another outbreak which might have had a dreadful ending but which as it fortunately happened was unattended with any unhappy results
this afternoon a carriers cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on oursthe house to which you will remember the patient twice ran away
the men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way as they were strangers
i was myself looking out of the study window having a smoke after dinner and saw one of them come up to the house
as he passed the window of renfields room the patient began to rate him from within and called him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to
the man who seemed a decent fellow enough contented himself by telling him to shut up for a foulmouthed beggar whereon our man accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it
i opened the window and signed to the man not to notice so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying lor bless yer sir i wouldnt mind what was said to me in a bloomin madhouse
i pity ye and the guvnor for havin to live in the house with a wild beast like that
then he asked his way civilly enough and i told him where the gate of the empty house was he went away followed by threats and curses and revilings from our man
i went down to see if i could make out any cause for his anger since he is usually such a wellbehaved man and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred
i found him to my astonishment quite composed and most genial in his manner
i tried to get him to talk of the incident but he blandly asked me questions as to what i meant and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair
it was i am sorry to say however only another instance of his cunning for within half an hour i heard of him again
this time he had broken out through the window of his room and was running down the avenue
i called to the attendants to follow me and ran after him for i feared he was intent on some mischief
my fear was justified when i saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road having on it some great wooden boxes
the men were wiping their foreheads and were flushed in the face as if with violent exercise
before i could get up to him the patient rushed at them and pulling one of them off the cart began to knock his head against the ground
if i had not seized him just at the moment i believe he would have killed the man there and then
the other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the buttend of his heavy whip
it was a terrible blow but he did not seem to mind it but seized him also and struggled with the three of us pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens
you know i am no light weight and the others were both burly men
at first he was silent in his fighting but as we began to master him and the attendants were putting a straitwaistcoat on him he began to shout ill frustrate them
they shant rob me
they shant murder me by inches
ill fight for my lord and master
and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings
it was with very considerable difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded room
one of the attendants hardy had a finger broken
however i set it all right and he is going on well
the two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for damages and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us
their threats were however mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman
they said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of him
they gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labours of any place of public entertainment
i quite understood their drift and after a stiff glass of grog or rather more of the same and with each a sovereign in hand they made light of the attack and swore that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so bloomin good a bloke as your correspondent
i took their names and addresses in case they might be needed
they are as followsjack smollet of duddings rents king georges road great walworth and thomas snelling peter farleys row guide court bethnal green
they are both in the employment of harris & sons moving and shipment company orange masters yard soho
i shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here and shall wire you at once if there is anything of importance
believe me dear sir yours faithfully patrick hennessey
my dearest lucy such a sad blow has befallen us
mr hawkins has died very suddenly
some may not think it so sad for us but we had both come to so love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father
i never knew either father or mother so that the dear old mans death is a real blow to me
jonathan is greatly distressed
it is not only that he feels sorrow deep sorrow for the dear good man who has befriended him all his life and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice but jonathan feels it on another account
he says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous
he begins to doubt himself
i try to cheer him up and my belief in him helps him to have a belief in himself
but it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most
oh it is too hard that a sweet simple noble strong nature such as hisa nature which enabled him by our dear good friends aid to rise from clerk to master in a few yearsshould be so injured that the very essence of its strength is gone
forgive me dear if i worry you with my troubles in the midst of your own happiness but lucy dear i must tell some one for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to jonathan tries me and i have no one here that i can confide in
i dread coming up to london as we must do the day after tomorrow for poor mr hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his father
as there are no relations at all jonathan will have to be chief mourner
i shall try to run over to see you dearest if only for a few minutes
forgive me for troubling you
with all blessings your loving mina harker
only resolution and habit can let me make an entry tonight
i am too miserable too lowspirited too sick of the world and all in it including life itself that i would not care if i heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death
and he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of latelucys mother and arthurs father and now
let me get on with my work
i duly relieved van helsing in his watch over lucy
we wanted arthur to go to rest also but he refused at first
it was only when i told him that we should want him to help us during the day and that we must not all break down for want of rest lest lucy should suffer that he agreed to go
van helsing was very kind to him
come my child he said come with me
you are sick and weak and have had much sorrow and much mental pain as well as that tax on your strength that we know of
you must not be alone for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms
come to the drawingroom where there is a big fire and there are two sofas
you shall lie on one and i on the other and our sympathy will be comfort to each other even though we do not speak and even if we sleep
arthur went off with him casting back a longing look on lucys face which lay in her pillow almost whiter than the lawn
she lay quite still and i looked round the room to see that all was as it should be
i could see that the professor had carried out in this room as in the other his purpose of using the garlic the whole of the windowsashes reeked with it and round lucys neck over the silk handkerchief which van helsing made her keep on was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers
lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously and her face was at its worst for the open mouth showed the pale gums
her teeth in the dim uncertain light seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning
in particular by some trick of the light the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest
i sat down by her and presently she moved uneasily
at the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window
i went over to it softly and peeped out by the corner of the blind
there was a full moonlight and i could see that the noise was made by a great bat which wheeled rounddoubtless attracted by the light although so dimand every now and again struck the window with its wings
when i came back to my seat i found that lucy had moved slightly and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat
i replaced them as well as i could and sat watching her
presently she woke and i gave her food as van helsing had prescribed
she took but a little and that languidly
there did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness
it struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her
it was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state with the stertorous breathing she put the flowers from her but that when she waked she clutched them close
there was no possibility of making any mistake about this for in the long hours that followed she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times
at six oclock van helsing came to relieve me
arthur had then fallen into a doze and he mercifully let him sleep on
when he saw lucys face i could hear the sissing indraw of his breath and he said to me in a sharp whisper draw up the blind i want light
then he bent down and with his face almost touching lucys examined her carefully
he removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat
as he did so he started back and i could hear his ejaculation mein gott
as it was smothered in his throat
i bent over and looked too and as i noticed some queer chill came over me
the wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared
for fully five minutes van helsing stood looking at her with his face at its sternest
then he turned to me and said calmly she is dying
it will not be long now
it will be much difference mark me whether she dies conscious or in her sleep
wake that poor boy and let him come and see the last he trusts us and we have promised him
i went to the diningroom and waked him
he was dazed for a moment but when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters he thought he was late and expressed his fear
i assured him that lucy was still asleep but told him as gently as i could that both van helsing and i feared that the end was near
he covered his face with his hands and slid down on his knees by the sofa where he remained perhaps a minute with his head buried praying whilst his shoulders shook with grief
i took him by the hand and raised him up
come i said my dear old fellow summon all your fortitude it will be best and easiest for her
when we came into lucys room i could see that van helsing had with his usual forethought been putting matters straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible
he had even brushed lucys hair so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples
when we came into the room she opened her eyes and seeing him whispered softly arthur
oh my love i am so glad you have come
he was stooping to kiss her when van helsing motioned him back
no he whispered not yet
hold her hand it will comfort her more
so arthur took her hand and knelt beside her and she looked her best with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes
then gradually her eyes closed and she sank to sleep
for a little bit her breast heaved softly and her breath came and went like a tired childs
and then insensibly there came the strange change which i had noticed in the night
her breathing grew stertorous the mouth opened and the pale gums drawn back made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever
in a sort of sleepwaking vague unconscious way she opened her eyes which were now dull and hard at once and said in a soft voluptuous voice such as i had never heard from her lips arthur
kiss me
arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her but at that instant van helsing who like me had been startled by her voice swooped upon him and catching him by the neck with both hands dragged him back with a fury of strength which i never thought he could have possessed and actually hurled him almost across the room
not for your life
he said not for your living soul and hers
and he stood between them like a lion at bay
arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do or say and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised the place and the occasion and stood silent waiting
i kept my eyes fixed on lucy as did van helsing and we saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face the sharp teeth champed together
then her eyes closed and she breathed heavily
very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness and putting out her poor pale thin hand took van helsings great brown one drawing it to her she kissed it
my true friend she said in a faint voice but with untellable pathos my true friend and his
oh guard him and give me peace
i swear it
he said solemnly kneeling beside her and holding up his hand as one who registers an oath
then he turned to arthur and said to him come my child take her hand in yours and kiss her on the forehead and only once
their eyes met instead of their lips and so they parted
lucys eyes closed and van helsing who had been watching closely took arthurs arm and drew him away
and then lucys breathing became stertorous again and all at once it ceased
it is all over said van helsing
she is dead
i took arthur by the arm and led him away to the drawingroom where he sat down and covered his face with his hands sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see
i went back to the room and found van helsing looking at poor lucy and his face was sterner than ever
some change had come over her body
death had given back part of her beauty for her brow and cheeks had recovered some of their flowing lines even the lips had lost their deadly pallor
it was as if the blood no longer needed for the working of the heart had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be
we thought her dying whilst she slept and sleeping when she died
i stood beside van helsing and said ah well poor girl there is peace for her at last
it is the end
he turned to me and said with grave solemnity not so alas
not so
it is only the beginning
when i asked him what he meant he only shook his head and answered we can do nothing as yet
wait and see
the funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day so that lucy and her mother might be buried together
i attended to all the ghastly formalities and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were afflictedor blessedwith something of his own obsequious suavity
even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me in a confidential brotherprofessional way when she had come out from the deathchamber she makes a very beautiful corpse sir
its quite a privilege to attend on her
its not too much to say that she will do credit to our establishment
i noticed that van helsing never kept far away
this was possible from the disordered state of things in the household
there were no relatives at hand and as arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his fathers funeral we were unable to notify any one who should have been bidden
under the circumstances van helsing and i took it upon ourselves to examine papers etc
he insisted upon looking over lucys papers himself
i asked him why for i feared that he being a foreigner might not be quite aware of english legal requirements and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble
he answered me i know i know
you forget that i am a lawyer as well as a doctor
but this is not altogether for the law
you knew that when you avoided the coroner
i have more than him to avoid
there may be papers moresuch as this
as he spoke he took from his pocketbook the memorandum which had been in lucys breast and which she had torn in her sleep
when you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late mr
westenra seal all her papers and write him tonight
for me i watch here in the room and in miss lucys old room all night and i myself search for what may be
it is not well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers
i went on with my part of the work and in another half hour had found the name and address of mr
westenras solicitor and had written to him
all the poor ladys papers were in order explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given
i had hardly sealed the letter when to my surprise van helsing walked into the room saying can i help you friend john
i am free and if i may my service is to you
have you got what you looked for
i asked to which he replied i did not look for any specific thing
i only hoped to find and find i have all that there wasonly some letters and a few memoranda and a diary new begun
but i have them here and we shall for the present say nothing of them
i shall see that poor lad tomorrow evening and with his sanction i shall use some
when we had finished the work in hand he said to me and now friend john i think we may to bed
we want sleep both you and i and rest to recuperate
tomorrow we shall have much to do but for the tonight there is no need of us
alas
before turning in we went to look at poor lucy
the undertaker had certainly done his work well for the room was turned into a small chapelle ardente
there was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers and death was made as little repulsive as might be
the end of the windingsheet was laid over the face when the professor bent over and turned it gently back we both started at the beauty before us the tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well
all lucys loveliness had come back to her in death and the hours that had passed instead of leaving traces of decays effacing fingers had but restored the beauty of life till positively i could not believe my eyes that i was looking at a corpse
the professor looked sternly grave
he had not loved her as i had and there was no need for tears in his eyes
he said to me remain till i return and left the room
he came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting in the hall but which had not been opened and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed
then he took from his neck inside his collar a little gold crucifix and placed it over the mouth
he restored the sheet to its place and we came away
i was undressing in my own room when with a premonitory tap at the door he entered and at once began to speak tomorrow i want you to bring me before night a set of postmortem knives
must we make an autopsy
yes and no
i want to operate but not as you think
let me tell you now but not a word to another
i want to cut off her head and take out her heart
you a surgeon and so shocked
you whom i have seen with no tremble of hand or heart do operations of life and death that make the rest shudder
oh but i must not forget my dear friend john that you loved her and i have not forgotten it for it is i that shall operate and you must only help
i would like to do it tonight but for arthur i must not he will be free after his fathers funeral tomorrow and he will want to see herto see it
then when she is coffined ready for the next day you and i shall come when all sleep
we shall unscrew the coffinlid and shall do our operation and then replace all so that none know save we alone
but why do it at all
the girl is dead
why mutilate her poor body without need
and if there is no necessity for a postmortem and nothing to gain by itno good to her to us to science to human knowledgewhy do it
without such it is monstrous
for answer he put his hand on my shoulder and said with infinite tenderness friend john i pity your poor bleeding heart and i love you the more because it does so bleed
if i could i would take on myself the burden that you do bear
but there are things that you know not but that you shall know and bless me for knowing though they are not pleasant things
john my child you have been my friend now many years and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause
i may erri am but man but i believe in all i do
was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came
were you not amazed nay horrified when i would not let arthur kiss his lovethough she was dyingand snatched him away by all my strength
and yet you saw how she thanked me with her so beautiful dying eyes her voice too so weak and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me
and did you not hear me swear promise to her that so she closed her eyes grateful
well i have good reason now for all i want to do
you have for many years trust me you have believe me weeks past when there be things so strange that you might have well doubt
believe me yet a little friend john
if you trust me not then i must tell what i think and that is not perhaps well
and if i workas work i shall no matter trust or no trustwithout my friend trust in me i work with heavy heart and feel oh
so lonely when i want all help and courage that may be
he paused a moment and went on solemnly friend john there are strange and terrible days before us
let us not be two but one that so we work to a good end
will you not have faith in me
i took his hand and promised him
i held my door open as he went away and watched him go into his room and close the door
as i stood without moving i saw one of the maids pass silently along the passageshe had her back towards me so did not see meand go into the room where lucy lay
the sight touched me
devotion is so rare and we are so grateful to those who show it unasked to those we love
here was a poor girl putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest
i must have slept long and soundly for it was broad daylight when van helsing waked me by coming into my room
he came over to my bedside and said you need not trouble about the knives we shall not do it
why not
for his solemnity of the night before had greatly impressed me
because he said sternly it is too lateor too early
here he held up the little golden crucifix
this was stolen in the night
how stolen i asked in wonder since you have it now
because i get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it from the woman who robbed the dead and the living
her punishment will surely come but not through me she knew not altogether what she did and thus unknowing she only stole
now we must wait
he went away on the word leaving me with a new mystery to think of a new puzzle to grapple with
the forenoon was a dreary time but at noon the solicitor came mr marquand of wholeman sons marquand & lidderdale
he was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done and took off our hands all cares as to details
during lunch he told us that mr
westenra had for some time expected sudden death from her heart and had put her affairs in absolute order he informed us that with the exception of a certain entailed property of lucys fathers which now in default of direct issue went back to a distant branch of the family the whole estate real and personal was left absolutely to arthur holmwood
when he had told us so much he went on frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance
indeed we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into collision for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes
of course we had then no alternative but to accept
we were right in principle and ninetynine times out of a hundred we should have proved by the logic of events the accuracy of our judgment
frankly however i must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes
for by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property and even had she only survived her mother by five minutes her property would in case there were no willand a will was a practical impossibility in such a casehave been treated at her decease as under intestacy
in which case lord godalming though so dear a friend would have had no claim in the world and the inheritors being remote would not be likely to abandon their just rights for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger
i assure you my dear sirs i am rejoiced at the result perfectly rejoiced
he was a good fellow but his rejoicing at the one little partin which he was officially interestedof so great a tragedy was an objectlesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding
he did not remain long but said he would look in later in the day and see lord godalming
his coming however had been a certain comfort to us since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of our acts
arthur was expected at five oclock so a little before that time we visited the deathchamber
it was so in very truth for now both mother and daughter lay in it
the undertaker true to his craft had made the best display he could of his goods and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at once
van helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to explaining that as lord godalming was coming very soon it would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his fiance quite alone
the undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them the night before so that when arthur came such shocks to his feelings as we could avoid were saved
poor fellow
he looked desperately sad and broken even his stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his muchtried emotions
he had i knew been very genuinely and devotedly attached to his father and to lose him and at such a time was a bitter blow to him
with me he was warm as ever and to van helsing he was sweetly courteous but i could not help seeing that there was some constraint with him
the professor noticed it too and motioned me to bring him upstairs
i did so and left him at the door of the room as i felt he would like to be quite alone with her but he took my arm and led me in saying huskily you loved her too old fellow she told me all about it and there was no friend had a closer place in her heart than you
i dont know how to thank you for all you have done for her
i cant think yet
here he suddenly broke down and threw his arms round my shoulders and laid his head on my breast crying oh jack
jack
the whole of life seems gone from me all at once and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for
i comforted him as well as i could
in such cases men do not need much expression
a grip of the hand the tightening of an arm over the shoulder a sob in unison are expressions of sympathy dear to a mans heart
i stood still and silent till his sobs died away and then i said softly to him come and look at her
together we moved over to the bed and i lifted the lawn from her face
how beautiful she was
every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness
it frightened and amazed me somewhat and as for arthur he fell atrembling and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague
at last after a long pause he said to me in a faint whisper jack is she really dead
i assured him sadly that it was so and went on to suggestfor i felt that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than i could helpthat it often happened that after death faces became softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty that this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering
it seemed to quite do away with any doubt and after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and long he turned aside
i told him that that must be goodbye as the coffin had to be prepared so he went back and took her dead hand in his and kissed it and bent over and kissed her forehead
he came away fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came
i left him in the drawingroom and told van helsing that he had said goodbye so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertakers men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin
when he came out of the room again i told him of arthurs question and he replied i am not surprised
just now i doubted for a moment myself
we all dined together and i could see that poor art was trying to make the best of things
van helsing had been silent all dinnertime but when we had lit our cigars he said lord but arthur interrupted him no no not that for gods sake
not yet at any rate
forgive me sir i did not mean to speak offensively it is only because my loss is so recent
the professor answered very sweetly i only used that name because i was in doubt
i must not call you mr and i have grown to love youyes my dear boy to love youas arthur
arthur held out his hand and took the old mans warmly
call me what you will he said
i hope i may always have the title of a friend
and let me say that i am at a loss for words to thank you for your goodness to my poor dear
he paused a moment and went on i know that she understood your goodness even better than i do and if i was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted soyou rememberthe professor noddedyou must forgive me
he answered with a grave kindness i know it was hard for you to quite trust me then for to trust such violence needs to understand and i take it that you do notthat you cannottrust me now for you do not yet understand
and there may be more times when i shall want you to trust when you cannotand may notand must not yet understand
but the time will come when your trust shall be whole and complete in me and when you shall understand as though the sunlight himself shone through
then you shall bless me from first to last for your own sake and for the sake of others and for her dear sake to whom i swore to protect
and indeed indeed sir said arthur warmly i shall in all ways trust you
i know and believe you have a very noble heart and you are jacks friend and you were hers
you shall do what you like
the professor cleared his throat a couple of times as though about to speak and finally said may i ask you something now
certainly
you know that mr
westenra left you all her property
no poor dear i never thought of it
and as it is all yours you have a right to deal with it as you will
i want you to give me permission to read all miss lucys papers and letters
believe me it is no idle curiosity
i have a motive of which be sure she would have approved
i have them all here
i took them before we knew that all was yours so that no strange hand might touch themno strange eye look through words into her soul
i shall keep them if i may even you may not see them yet but i shall keep them safe
no word shall be lost and in the good time i shall give them back to you
its a hard thing i ask but you will do it will you not for lucys sake
arthur spoke out heartily like his old self dr van helsing you may do what you will
i feel that in saying this i am doing what my dear one would have approved
i shall not trouble you with questions till the time comes
the old professor stood up as he said solemnly and you are right
there will be pain for us all but it will not be all pain nor will this pain be the last
we and you tooyou most of all my dear boywill have to pass through the bitter water before we reach the sweet
but we must be brave of heart and unselfish and do our duty and all will be well
i slept on a sofa in arthurs room that night
van helsing did not go to bed at all
he went to and fro as if patrolling the house and was never out of sight of the room where lucy lay in her coffin strewn with the wild garlic flowers which sent through the odour of lily and rose a heavy overpowering smell into the night
mina harkers journal
22 september
in the train to exeter
jonathan sleeping
it seems only yesterday that the last entry was made and yet how much between then in whitby and all the world before me jonathan away and no news of him and now married to jonathan jonathan a solicitor a partner rich master of his business mr hawkins dead and buried and jonathan with another attack that may harm him
some day he may ask me about it
down it all goes
i am rusty in my shorthandsee what unexpected prosperity does for usso it may be as well to freshen it up again with an exercise anyhow
the service was very simple and very solemn
there were only ourselves and the servants there one or two old friends of his from exeter his london agent and a gentleman representing sir john paxton the president of the incorporated law society
jonathan and i stood hand in hand and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us
we came back to town quietly taking a bus to hyde park corner
jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the row for a while so we sat down but there were very few people there and it was sadlooking and desolate to see so many empty chairs
it made us think of the empty chair at home so we got up and walked down piccadilly
jonathan was holding me by the arm the way he used to in old days before i went to school
i felt it very improper for you cant go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit but it was jonathan and he was my husband and we didnt know anybody who saw usand we didnt care if they didso on we walked
i was looking at a very beautiful girl in a big cartwheel hat sitting in a victoria outside guilianos when i felt jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me and he said under his breath my god
i am always anxious about jonathan for i fear that some nervous fit may upset him again so i turned to him quickly and asked him what it was that disturbed him
he was very pale and his eyes seemed bulging out as half in terror and half in amazement he gazed at a tall thin man with a beaky nose and black moustache and pointed beard who was also observing the pretty girl
he was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us and so i had a good view of him
his face was not a good face it was hard and cruel and sensual and his big white teeth that looked all the whiter because his lips were so red were pointed like an animals
jonathan kept staring at him till i was afraid he would notice
i feared he might take it ill he looked so fierce and nasty
i asked jonathan why he was disturbed and he answered evidently thinking that i knew as much about it as he did do you see who it is
no dear i said i dont know him who is it
his answer seemed to shock and thrill me for it was said as if he did not know that it was to me mina to whom he was speaking it is the man himself
the poor dear was evidently terrified at somethingvery greatly terrified i do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to support him he would have sunk down
he kept staring a man came out of the shop with a small parcel and gave it to the lady who then drove off
the dark man kept his eyes fixed on her and when the carriage moved up piccadilly he followed in the same direction and hailed a hansom
jonathan kept looking after him and said as if to himself i believe it is the count but he has grown young
my god if this be so
oh my god
if i only knew
he was distressing himself so much that i feared to keep his mind on the subject by asking him any questions so i remained silent
i drew him away quietly and he holding my arm came easily
we walked a little further and then went in and sat for a while in the green park
it was a hot day for autumn and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place
after a few minutes staring at nothing jonathans eyes closed and he went quietly into a sleep with his head on my shoulder
i thought it was the best thing for him so did not disturb him
in about twenty minutes he woke up and said to me quite cheerfully why mina have i been asleep
oh do forgive me for being so rude
come and well have a cup of tea somewhere
he had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger as in his illness he had forgotten all that this episode had reminded him of
i dont like this lapsing into forgetfulness it may make or continue some injury to the brain
i must not ask him for fear i shall do more harm than good but i must somehow learn the facts of his journey abroad
the time is come i fear when i must open that parcel and know what is written
oh jonathan you will i know forgive me if i do wrong but it is for your own dear sake
a sad homecoming in every waythe house empty of the dear soul who was so good to us jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady and now a telegram from van helsing whoever he may be you will be grieved to hear that mr
westenra died five days ago and that lucy died the day before yesterday
they were both buried today
oh what a wealth of sorrow in a few words
poor mr
westenra
poor lucy
gone gone never to return to us
and poor poor arthur to have lost such sweetness out of his life
god help us all to bear our troubles
it is all over
arthur has gone back to ring and has taken quincey morris with him
what a fine fellow is quincey
i believe in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about lucys death as any of us but he bore himself through it like a moral viking
if america can go on breeding men like that she will be a power in the world indeed
van helsing is lying down having a rest preparatory to his journey
he goes over to amsterdam tonight but says he returns tomorrow night that he only wants to make some arrangements which can only be made personally
he is to stop with me then if he can he says he has work to do in london which may take him some time
poor old fellow
i fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his iron strength
all the time of the burial he was i could see putting some terrible restraint on himself
when it was all over we were standing beside arthur who poor fellow was speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his lucys veins i could see van helsings face grow white and purple by turns
arthur was saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married and that she was his wife in the sight of god
none of us said a word of the other operations and none of us ever shall
arthur and quincey went away together to the station and van helsing and i came on here
the moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of hysterics
he has denied to me since that it was hysterics and insisted that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very terrible conditions
he laughed till he cried and i had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge and then he cried till he laughed again and laughed and cried together just as a woman does
i tried to be stern with him as one is to a woman under the circumstances but it had no effect
men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness
then when his face grew grave and stern again i asked him why his mirth and why at such a time
his reply was in a way characteristic of him for it was logical and forceful and mysterious
he said ah you dont comprehend friend john
do not think that i am not sad though i laugh
see i have cried even when the laugh did choke me
but no more think that i am all sorry when i cry for the laugh he come just the same
keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and say may i come in
is not the true laughter
he is a king and he come when and how he like
he ask no person he choose no time of suitability
he say i am here
behold in example i grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl i give my blood for her though i am old and worn i give my time my skill my sleep i let my other sufferers want that so she may have all
and yet i can laugh at her very gravelaugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say thud
thud
to my heart till it send back the blood from my cheek
my heart bleed for that poor boythat dear boy so of the age of mine own boy had i been so blessed that he live and with his hair and eyes the same
there you know now why i love him so
and yet when he say things that touch my husbandheart to the quick and make my fatherheart yearn to him as to no other mannot even to you friend john for we are more level in experiences than father and sonyet even at such moment king laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear here i am
here i am
till the blood come dance back and bring some of the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek
oh friend john it is a strange world a sad world a world full of miseries and woes and troubles and yet when king laugh come he make them all dance to the tune he play
bleeding hearts and dry bones of the churchyard and tears that burn as they fallall dance together to the music that he make with that smileless mouth of him
and believe me friend john that he is good to come and kind
ah we men and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways
then tears come and like the rain on the ropes they brace us up until perhaps the strain become too great and we break
but king laugh he come like the sunshine and he ease off the strain again and we bear to go on with our labour what it may be
i did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea but as i did not yet understand the cause of his laughter i asked him
as he answered me his face grew stern and he said in quite a different tone oh it was the grim irony of it allthis so lovely lady garlanded with flowers that looked so fair as life till one by one we wondered if she were truly dead she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely churchyard where rest so many of her kin laid there with the mother who loved her and whom she loved and that sacred bell going toll
toll
so sad and slow and those holy men with the white garments of the angel pretending to read books and yet all the time their eyes never on the page and all of us with the bowed head
and all for what
she is dead so
is it not
well for the life of me professor i said i cant see anything to laugh at in all that
why your explanation makes it a harder puzzle than before
but even if the burial service was comic what about poor art and his trouble
why his heart was simply breaking
just so
said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had made her truly his bride
yes and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him
quite so
but there was a difficulty friend john
if so that then what about the others
ho ho
then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist and me with my poor wife dead to me but alive by churchs law though no wits all goneeven i who am faithful husband to this nownowife am bigamist
i dont see where the joke comes in there either
i said and i did not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things
he laid his hand on my arm and said friend john forgive me if i pain
i showed not my feeling to others when it would wound but only to you my old friend whom i can trust
if you could have looked into my very heart then when i want to laugh if you could have done so when the laugh arrived if you could do so now when king laugh have pack up his crown and all that is to himfor he go far far away from me and for a long long timemaybe you would perhaps pity me the most of all
i was touched by the tenderness of his tone and asked why
because i know
and now we are all scattered and for many a long day loneliness will sit over our roofs with brooding wings
lucy lies in the tomb of her kin a lordly deathhouse in a lonely churchyard away from teeming london where the air is fresh and the sun rises over hampstead hill and where wild flowers grow of their own accord
so i can finish this diary and god only knows if i shall ever begin another
if i do or if i even open this again it will be to deal with different people and different themes for here at the end where the romance of my life is told ere i go back to take up the thread of my lifework i say sadly and without hope finis
the westminster gazette 25 september
a hampstead mystery
the neighbourhood of hampstead is just at present exercised with a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what was known to the writers of headlines as the kensington horror or the stabbing woman or the woman in black
during the past two or three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from home or neglecting to return from their playing on the heath
in all these cases the children were too young to give any properly intelligible account of themselves but the consensus of their excuses is that they had been with a bloofer lady
it has always been late in the evening when they have been missed and on two occasions the children have not been found until early in the following morning
it is generally supposed in the neighbourhood that as the first child missed gave as his reason for being away that a bloofer lady had asked him to come for a walk the others had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served
this is the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles
a correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the bloofer lady is supremely funny
some of our caricaturists might he says take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture
it is only in accordance with general principles of human nature that the bloofer lady should be the popular rle at these al fresco performances
our correspondent navely says that even ellen terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of these grubbyfaced little children pretendand even imagine themselvesto be
there is however possibly a serious side to the question for some of the children indeed all who have been missed at night have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat
the wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small dog and although of not much importance individually would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method of its own
the police of the division have been instructed to keep a sharp lookout for straying children especially when very young in and around hampstead heath and for any stray dog which may be about
extra special
the hampstead horror
another child injured
the bloofer lady
we have just received intelligence that another child missed last night was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the shooters hill side of hampstead heath which is perhaps less frequented than the other parts
it has the same tiny wound in the throat as has been noticed in other cases
it was terribly weak and looked quite emaciated
it too when partially restored had the common story to tell of being lured away by the bloofer lady
jonathan is better after a bad night
i am so glad that he has plenty of work to do for that keeps his mind off the terrible things and oh i am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the responsibility of his new position
i knew he would be true to himself and now how proud i am to see my jonathan rising to the height of his advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon him
he will be away all day till late for he said he could not lunch at home
my household work is done so i shall take his foreign journal and lock myself up in my room and read it
24 september
i hadnt the heart to write last night that terrible record of jonathans upset me so
poor dear
how he must have suffered whether it be true or only imagination
i wonder if there is any truth in it at all
did he get his brain fever and then write all those terrible things or had he some cause for it all
i suppose i shall never know for i dare not open the subject to him
and yet that man we saw yesterday
he seemed quite certain of him
i suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some train of thought
he believes it all himself
i remember how on our weddingday he said unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to the bitter hours asleep or awake mad or sane
there seems to be through it all some thread of continuity
that fearful count was coming to london
if it should be and he came to london with his teeming millions
there may be a solemn duty and if it come we must not shrink from it
i shall be prepared
i shall get my typewriter this very hour and begin transcribing
then we shall be ready for other eyes if required
and if it be wanted then perhaps if i am ready poor jonathan may not be upset for i can speak for him and never let him be troubled or worried with it at all
if ever jonathan quite gets over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all and i can ask him questions and find out things and see how i may comfort him
letter van helsing to mr
harker
confidence dear madam i pray you to pardon my writing in that i am so far friend as that i sent to you sad news of miss lucy westenras death
by the kindness of lord godalming i am empowered to read her letters and papers for i am deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important
in them i find some letters from you which show how great friends you were and how you love her
oh madam mina by that love i implore you help me
it is for others good that i askto redress great wrong and to lift much and terrible troublesthat may be more great than you can know
may it be that i see you
you can trust me
i am friend of dr john seward and of lord godalming that was arthur of miss lucy
i must keep it private for the present from all
i should come to exeter to see you at once if you tell me i am privilege to come and where and when
i implore your pardon madam
i have read your letters to poor lucy and know how good you are and how your husband suffer so i pray you if it may be enlighten him not lest it may harm
again your pardon and forgive me
telegram mr
harker to van helsing
25 september
come today by quarterpast ten train if you can catch it
can see you any time you call
wilhelmina harker
i cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time draws near for the visit of dr van helsing for somehow i expect that it will throw some light upon jonathans sad experience and as he attended poor dear lucy in her last illness he can tell me all about her
that is the reason of his coming it is concerning lucy and her sleepwalking and not about jonathan
then i shall never know the real truth now
how silly i am
that awful journal gets hold of my imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour
of course it is about lucy
that habit came back to the poor dear and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill
i had almost forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards
she must have told him of her sleepwalking adventure on the cliff and that i knew all about it and now he wants me to tell him what she knows so that he may understand
i hope i did right in not saying anything of it to mr
westenra i should never forgive myself if any act of mine were it even a negative one brought harm on poor dear lucy
i hope too dr van helsing will not blame me i have had so much trouble and anxiety of late that i feel i cannot bear more just at present
i suppose a cry does us all good at timesclears the air as other rain does
perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me and then jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day and night the first time we have been parted since our marriage
i do hope the dear fellow will take care of himself and that nothing will occur to upset him
it is two oclock and the doctor will be here soon now
i shall say nothing of jonathans journal unless he asks me
i am so glad i have typewritten out my own journal so that in case he asks about lucy i can hand it to him it will save much questioning
he has come and gone
oh what a strange meeting and how it all makes my head whirl round
i feel like one in a dream
can it be all possible or even a part of it
if i had not read jonathans journal first i should never have accepted even a possibility
poor poor dear jonathan
how he must have suffered
please the good god all this may not upset him again
i shall try to save him from it but it may be even a consolation and a help to himterrible though it be and awful in its consequencesto know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did not deceive him and that it is all true
it may be that it is the doubt which haunts him that when the doubt is removed no matter whichwaking or dreamingmay prove the truth he will be more satisfied and better able to bear the shock
dr van helsing must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is arthurs friend and dr sewards and if they brought him all the way from holland to look after lucy
i feel from having seen him that he is good and kind and of a noble nature
when he comes tomorrow i shall ask him about jonathan and then please god all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end
i used to think i would like to practise interviewing jonathans friend on the exeter news told him that memory was everything in such workthat you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken even if you had to refine some of it afterwards
here was a rare interview i shall try to record it verbatim
it was halfpast two oclock when the knock came
i took my courage  deux mains and waited
in a few minutes mary opened the door and announced dr van helsing
i rose and bowed and he came towards me a man of medium weight strongly built with his shoulders set back over a broad deep chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck
the poise of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power the head is noble wellsized broad and large behind the ears
the face cleanshaven shows a hard square chin a large resolute mobile mouth a goodsized nose rather straight but with quick sensitive nostrils that seem to broaden as the big bushy brows come down and the mouth tightens
the forehead is broad and fine rising at first almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it but falls naturally back and to the sides
big dark blue eyes are set widely apart and are quick and tender or stern with the mans moods
he said to me mr
harker is it not
i bowed assent
that was miss mina murray
again i assented
it is mina murray that i came to see that was friend of that poor dear child lucy westenra
madam mina it is on account of the dead i come
sir i said you could have no better claim on me than that you were a friend and helper of lucy westenra
and i held out my hand
he took it and said tenderly oh madam mina i knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be good but i had yet to learn he finished his speech with a courtly bow
i asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about so he at once began i have read your letters to miss lucy
forgive me but i had to begin to inquire somewhere and there was none to ask
i know that you were with her at whitby
she sometimes kept a diaryyou need not look surprised madam mina it was begun after you had left and was in imitation of youand in that diary she traces by inference certain things to a sleepwalking in which she puts down that you saved her
in great perplexity then i come to you and ask you out of your so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember
i can tell you i think dr van helsing all about it
ah then you have good memory for facts for details
it is not always so with young ladies
no doctor but i wrote it all down at the time
i can show it to you if you like
oh madam mina i will be grateful you will do me much favour
i could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a biti suppose it is some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our mouthsso i handed him the shorthand diary
he took it with a grateful bow and said may i read it
if you wish i answered as demurely as i could
he opened it and for an instant his face fell
then he stood up and bowed
oh you so clever woman
i knew long that mr jonathan was a man of much thankfulness but see his wife have all the good things
and will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me
i know not the shorthand
by this time my little joke was over and i was almost ashamed so i took the typewritten copy from my workbasket and handed it to him
forgive me i said i could not help it but i had been thinking that it was of dear lucy that you wished to ask and so that you might not have time to waitnot on my account but because i know your time must be preciousi have written it out on the typewriter for you
he took it and his eyes glistened
you are so good he said
and may i read it now
i may want to ask you some things when i have read
by all means i said read it over whilst i order lunch and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat
he bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light and became absorbed in the papers whilst i went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be disturbed
when i came back i found him walking hurriedly up and down the room his face all ablaze with excitement
he rushed up to me and took me by both hands
oh madam mina he said how can i say what i owe to you
this paper is as sunshine
it opens the gate to me
i am daze i am dazzle with so much light and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time
but that you do not cannot comprehend
oh but i am grateful to you you so clever woman
madamhe said this very solemnlyif ever abraham van helsing can do anything for you or yours i trust you will let me know
it will be pleasure and delight if i may serve you as a friend as a friend but all i have ever learned all i can ever do shall be for you and those you love
there are darknesses in life and there are lights you are one of the lights
you will have happy life and good life and your husband will be blessed in you
but doctor you praise me too much andand you do not know me
not know youi who am old and who have studied all my life men and women i who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to him and all that follow from him
and i have read your diary that you have so goodly written for me and which breathes out truth in every line
i who have read your so sweet letter to poor lucy of your marriage and your trust not know you
oh madam mina good women tell all their lives and by day and by hour and by minute such things that angels can read and we men who wish to know have in us something of angels eyes
your husband is noble nature and you are noble too for you trust and trust cannot be where there is mean nature
and your husbandtell me of him
is he quite well
is all that fever gone and is he strong and hearty
i saw here an opening to ask him about jonathan so i said he was almost recovered but he has been greatly upset by mr hawkinss death
he interrupted oh yes i know i know
i have read your last two letters
i went on i suppose this upset him for when we were in town on thursday last he had a sort of shock
a shock and after brain fever so soon
that was not good
what kind of a shock was it
he thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible something which led to his brain fever
and here the whole thing seemed to overwhelm me in a rush
the pity for jonathan the horror which he experienced the whole fearful mystery of his diary and the fear that has been brooding over me ever since all came in a tumult
i suppose i was hysterical for i threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to him and implored him to make my husband well again
he took my hands and raised me up and made me sit on the sofa and sat by me he held my hand in his and said to me with oh such infinite sweetness my life is a barren and lonely one and so full of work that i have not had much time for friendships but since i have been summoned to here by my friend john seward i have known so many good people and seen such nobility that i feel more than everand it has grown with my advancing yearsthe loneliness of my life
believe me then that i come here full of respect for you and you have given me hopehope not in what i am seeking of but that there are good women still left to make life happygood women whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for the children that are to be
i am glad glad that i may here be of some use to you for if your husband suffer he suffer within the range of my study and experience
i promise you that i will gladly do all for him that i canall to make his life strong and manly and your life a happy one
now you must eat
you are overwrought and perhaps overanxious
husband jonathan would not like to see you so pale and what he like not where he love is not to his good
therefore for his sake you must eat and smile
you have told me all about lucy and so now we shall not speak of it lest it distress
i shall stay in exeter tonight for i want to think much over what you have told me and when i have thought i will ask you questions if i may
and then too you will tell me of husband jonathans trouble so far as you can but not yet
you must eat now afterwards you shall tell me all
after lunch when we went back to the drawingroom he said to me and now tell me all about him
when it came to speaking to this great learned man i began to fear that he would think me a weak fool and jonathan a madmanthat journal is all so strangeand i hesitated to go on
but he was so sweet and kind and he had promised to help and i trusted him so i said dr van helsing what i have to tell you is so queer that you must not laugh at me or at my husband
i have been since yesterday in a sort of fever of doubt you must be kind to me and not think me foolish that i have even half believed some very strange things
he reassured me by his manner as well as his words when he said oh my dear if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which i am here it is you who would laugh
i have learned not to think little of any ones belief no matter how strange it be
i have tried to keep an open mind and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close it but the strange things the extraordinary things the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane
thank you thank you a thousand times
you have taken a weight off my mind
if you will let me i shall give you a paper to read
it is long but i have typewritten it out
it will tell you my trouble and jonathans
it is the copy of his journal when abroad and all that happened
i dare not say anything of it you will read for yourself and judge
and then when i see you perhaps you will be very kind and tell me what you think
i promise he said as i gave him the papers i shall in the morning so soon as i can come to see you and your husband if i may
jonathan will be here at halfpast eleven and you must come to lunch with us and see him then you could catch the quick 334 train which will leave you at paddington before eight
he was surprised at my knowledge of the trains offhand but he does not know that i have made up all the trains to and from exeter so that i may help jonathan in case he is in a hurry
so he took the papers with him and went away and i sit here thinkingthinking i dont know what
letter by hand van helsing to mr
25 september 6 oclock
dear madam mina i have read your husbands so wonderful diary
you may sleep without doubt
strange and terrible as it is it is true
i will pledge my life on it
it may be worse for others but for him and you there is no dread
he is a noble fellow and let me tell you from experience of men that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to that roomay and going a second timeis not one to be injured in permanence by a shock
his brain and his heart are all right this i swear before i have even seen him so be at rest
i shall have much to ask him of other things
i am blessed that today i come to see you for i have learn all at once so much that again i am dazzledazzle more than ever and i must think
yours the most faithful abraham van helsing
letter mr
25 september 630 pm my dear dr van helsing a thousand thanks for your kind letter which has taken a great weight off my mind
and yet if it be true what terrible things there are in the world and what an awful thing if that man that monster be really in london
i fear to think
i have this moment whilst writing had a wire from jonathan saying that he leaves by the 625 tonight from launceston and will be here at 1018 so that i shall have no fear tonight
will you therefore instead of lunching with us please come to breakfast at eight oclock if this be not too early for you
you can get away if you are in a hurry by the 1030 train which will bring you to paddington by 235
do not answer this as i shall take it that if i do not hear you will come to breakfast
believe me your faithful and grateful friend mina harker
jonathan harkers journal
26 september
i thought never to write in this diary again but the time has come
when i got home last night mina had supper ready and when we had supped she told me of van helsings visit and of her having given him the two diaries copied out and of how anxious she has been about me
she showed me in the doctors letter that all i wrote down was true
it seems to have made a new man of me
it was the doubt as to the reality of the whole thing that knocked me over
i felt impotent and in the dark and distrustful
but now that i know i am not afraid even of the count
he has succeeded after all then in his design in getting to london and it was he i saw
he has got younger and how
van helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out if he is anything like what mina says
we sat late and talked it all over
mina is dressing and i shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over
he was i think surprised to see me
when i came into the room where he was and introduced myself he took me by the shoulder and turned my face round to the light and said after a sharp scrutiny but madam mina told me you were ill that you had had a shock
it was so funny to hear my wife called madam mina by this kindly strongfaced old man
i smiled and said i was ill i have had a shock but you have cured me already
and how
by your letter to mina last night
i was in doubt and then everything took a hue of unreality and i did not know what to trust even the evidence of my own senses
not knowing what to trust i did not know what to do and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been the groove of my life
the groove ceased to avail me and i mistrusted myself
doctor you dont know what it is to doubt everything even yourself
no you dont you couldnt with eyebrows like yours
he seemed pleased and laughed as he said so
you are physiognomist
i learn more here with each hour
i am with so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast and oh sir you will pardon praise from an old man but you are blessed in your wife
i would listen to him go on praising mina for a day so i simply nodded and stood silent
she is one of gods women fashioned by his own hand to show us men and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter and that its light can be here on earth
so true so sweet so noble so little an egoistand that let me tell you is much in this age so sceptical and selfish
and you siri have read all the letters to poor miss lucy and some of them speak of you so i know you since some days from the knowing of others but i have seen your true self since last night
you will give me your hand will you not
and let us be friends for all our lives
we shook hands and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite choky
and now he said may i ask you for some more help
i have a great task to do and at the beginning it is to know
you can help me here
can you tell me what went before your going to transylvania
later on i may ask more help and of a different kind but at first this will do
look here sir i said does what you have to do concern the count
it does he said solemnly
then i am with you heart and soul
as you go by the 1030 train you will not have time to read them but i shall get the bundle of papers
you can take them with you and read them in the train
after breakfast i saw him to the station
when we were parting he said perhaps you will come to town if i send to you and take madam mina too
we shall both come when you will i said
i had got him the morning papers and the london papers of the previous night and while we were talking at the carriage window waiting for the train to start he was turning them over
his eyes suddenly seemed to catch something in one of them the westminster gazettei knew it by the colourand he grew quite white
he read something intently groaning to himself mein gott
mein gott
so soon
i do not think he remembered me at the moment
just then the whistle blew and the train moved off
this recalled him to himself and he leaned out of the window and waved his hand calling out love to madam mina i shall write so soon as ever i can
truly there is no such thing as finality
not a week since i said finis and yet here i am starting fresh again or rather going on with the same record
until this afternoon i had no cause to think of what is done
renfield had become to all intents as sane as he ever was
he was already well ahead with his fly business and he had just started in the spider line also so he had not been of any trouble to me
i had a letter from arthur written on sunday and from it i gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well
quincey morris is with him and that is much of a help for he himself is a bubbling well of good spirits
quincey wrote me a line too and from him i hear that arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy so as to them all my mind is at rest
as for myself i was settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which i used to have for it so that i might fairly have said that the wound which poor lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised
everything is however now reopened and what is to be the end god only knows
i have an idea that van helsing thinks he knows too but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity
he went to exeter yesterday and stayed there all night
today he came back and almost bounded into the room at about halfpast five oclock and thrust last nights westminster gazette into my hand
what do you think of that
he asked as he stood back and folded his arms
i looked over the paper for i really did not know what he meant but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed away at hampstead
it did not convey much to me until i reached a passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats
an idea struck me and i looked up
it is like poor lucys
and what do you make of it
simply that there is some cause in common
whatever it was that injured her has injured them
i did not quite understand his answer that is true indirectly but not directly
how do you mean professor
i was a little inclined to take his seriousness lightlyfor after all four days of rest and freedom from burning harrowing anxiety does help to restore ones spiritsbut when i saw his face it sobered me
never even in the midst of our despair about poor lucy had he looked more stern
tell me
i can hazard no opinion
i do not know what to think and i have no data on which to found a conjecture
do you mean to tell me friend john that you have no suspicion as to what poor lucy died of not after all the hints given not only by events but by me
of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood
and how the blood lost or waste
he stepped over and sat down beside me and went on you are clever man friend john you reason well and your wit is bold but you are too prejudiced
you do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to you
do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand and yet which are that some people see things that others cannot
but there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by mens eyes because they knowor think they knowsome things which other men have told them
ah it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all and if it explain not then it says there is nothing to explain
but yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs which think themselves new and which are yet but the old which pretend to be younglike the fine ladies at the opera
i suppose now you do not believe in corporeal transference
nor in materialisation
nor in astral bodies
nor in the reading of thought
nor in hypnotism yes i said
charcot has proved that pretty well
he smiled as he went on then you are satisfied as to it
and of course then you understand how it act and can follow the mind of the great charcotalas that he is no more
into the very soul of the patient that he influence
then friend john am i to take it that you simply accept fact and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a blank
then tell mefor i am student of the brainhow you accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading
let me tell you my friend that there are things done today in electrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered electricitywho would themselves not so long before have been burned as wizards
there are always mysteries in life
why was it that methuselah lived nine hundred years and old parr one hundred and sixtynine and yet that poor lucy with four mens blood in her poor veins could not live even one day
for had she live one more day we could have save her
do you know all the mystery of life and death
do you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the qualities of brutes are in some men and not in others
can you tell me why when other spiders die small and soon that one great spider lived for centuries in the tower of the old spanish church and grew and grew till on descending he could drink the oil of all the church lamps
can you tell me why in the pampas ay and elsewhere there are bats that come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their veins how in some islands of the western seas there are bats which hang on the trees all day and those who have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods and that when the sailors sleep on the deck because that it is hot flit down on them and thenand then in the morning are found dead men white as even miss lucy was
good god professor
i said starting up
do you mean to tell me that lucy was bitten by such a bat and that such a thing is here in london in the nineteenth century
he waved his hand for silence and went on can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of men why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint
can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are some few who live on always if they be permit that there are men and women who cannot die
we all knowbecause science has vouched for the factthat there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of years shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of the world
can you tell me how the indian fakir can make himself to die and have been buried and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it and the corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again and then men come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the indian fakir not dead but that rise up and walk amongst them as before
here i interrupted him
i was getting bewildered he so crowded on my mind his list of natures eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my imagination was getting fired
i had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson as long ago he used to do in his study at amsterdam but he used then to tell me the thing so that i could have the object of thought in mind all the time
but now i was without this help yet i wanted to follow him so i said professor let me be your pet student again
tell me the thesis so that i may apply your knowledge as you go on
at present i am going in my mind from point to point as a mad man and not a sane one follows an idea
i feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist jumping from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without knowing where i am going
that is good image he said
well i shall tell you
my thesis is this i want you to believe
to believe what
to believe in things that you cannot
let me illustrate
i heard once of an american who so defined faith that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue
for one i follow that man
he meant that we shall have an open mind and not let a little bit of truth check the rush of a big truth like a small rock does a railway truck
we get the small truth first
we keep him and we value him but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in the universe
then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter
do i read your lesson aright
ah you are my favourite pupil still
it is worth to teach you
now that you are willing to understand you have taken the first step to understand
you think then that those so small holes in the childrens throats were made by the same that made the hole in miss lucy
i suppose so
he stood up and said solemnly then you are wrong
oh would it were so
it is worse far far worse
in gods name professor van helsing what do you mean
i cried
he threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair and placed his elbows on the table covering his face with his hands as he spoke they were made by miss lucy
for a while sheer anger mastered me it was as if he had during her life struck lucy on the face
i smote the table hard and rose up as i said to him dr van helsing are you mad
he raised his head and looked at me and somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once
would i were
madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this
oh my friend why think you did i go so far round why take so long to tell you so simple a thing
was it because i hate you and have hated you all my life
was it because i wished to give you pain
was it that i wanted now so late revenge for that time when you saved my life and from a fearful death
ah no
forgive me said i
he went on my friend it was because i wished to be gentle in the breaking to you for i know you have loved that so sweet lady
but even yet i do not expect you to believe
it is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believed the no of it it is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth and of such a one as miss lucy
tonight i go to prove it
dare you come with me
this staggered me
a man does not like to prove such a truth byron excepted from the category jealousy
and prove the very truth he most abhorred
he saw my hesitation and spoke the logic is simple no madmans logic this time jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog
if it be not true then proof will be relief at worst it will not harm
if it be true
ah there is the dread yet very dread should help my cause for in it is some need of belief
come i tell you what i propose first that we go off now and see that child in the hospital
dr vincent of the north hospital where the papers say the child is is friend of mine and i think of yours since you were in class at amsterdam
he will let two scientists see his case if he will not let two friends
we shall tell him nothing but only that we wish to learn
and then and then
he took a key from his pocket and held it up
and then we spend the night you and i in the churchyard where lucy lies
this is the key that lock the tomb
i had it from the coffinman to give to arthur
my heart sank within me for i felt that there was some fearful ordeal before us
i could do nothing however so i plucked up what heart i could and said that we had better hasten as the afternoon was passing
we found the child awake
it had had a sleep and taken some food and altogether was going on well
dr vincent took the bandage from its throat and showed us the punctures
there was no mistaking the similarity to those which had been on lucys throat
they were smaller and the edges looked fresher that was all
we asked vincent to what he attributed them and he replied that it must have been a bite of some animal perhaps a rat but for his own part he was inclined to think that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of london
out of so many harmless ones he said there may be some wild specimen from the south of a more malignant species
some sailor may have brought one home and it managed to escape or even from the zological gardens a young one may have got loose or one be bred there from a vampire
these things do occur you know
only ten days ago a wolf got out and was i believe traced up in this direction
for a week after the children were playing nothing but red riding hood on the heath and in every alley in the place until this bloofer lady scare came along since when it has been quite a galatime with them
even this poor little mite when he woke up today asked the nurse if he might go away
when she asked him why he wanted to go he said he wanted to play with the bloofer lady
i hope said van helsing that when you are sending the child home you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it
these fancies to stray are most dangerous and if the child were to remain out another night it would probably be fatal
but in any case i suppose you will not let it away for some days
certainly not not for a week at least longer if the wound is not healed
our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on and the sun had dipped before we came out
when van helsing saw how dark it was he said there is no hurry
it is more late than i thought
come let us seek somewhere that we may eat and then we shall go on our way
we dined at jack straws castle along with a little crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy
about ten oclock we started from the inn
it was then very dark and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radius
the professor had evidently noted the road we were to go for he went on unhesitatingly but as for me i was in quite a mixup as to locality
as we went further we met fewer and fewer people till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round
at last we reached the wall of the churchyard which we climbed over
with some little difficultyfor it was very dark and the whole place seemed so strange to uswe found the westenra tomb
the professor took the key opened the creaky door and standing back politely but quite unconsciously motioned me to precede him
there was a delicious irony in the offer in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion
my companion followed me quickly and cautiously drew the door to after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling and not a spring one
in the latter case we should have been in a bad plight
then he fumbled in his bag and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle proceeded to make a light
the tomb in the daytime and when wreathed with fresh flowers had looked grim and gruesome enough but now some days afterwards when the flowers hung lank and dead their whites turning to rust and their greens to browns when the spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance when timediscoloured stone and dustencrusted mortar and rusty dank iron and tarnished brass and clouded silverplating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined
it conveyed irresistibly the idea that lifeanimal lifewas not the only thing which could pass away
van helsing went about his work systematically
holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal he made assurance of lucys coffin
another search in his bag and he took out a turnscrew
what are you going to do
to open the coffin
you shall yet be convinced
straightway he began taking out the screws and finally lifted off the lid showing the casing of lead beneath
the sight was almost too much for me
it seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living i actually took hold of his hand to stop him
he only said you shall see and again fumbling in his bag took out a tiny fretsaw
striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab which made me wince he made a small hole which was however big enough to admit the point of the saw
i had expected a rush of gas from the weekold corpse
we doctors who have had to study our dangers have to become accustomed to such things and i drew back towards the door
but the professor never stopped for a moment he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin and then across and down the other side
taking the edge of the loose flange he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin and holding up the candle into the aperture motioned to me to look
i drew near and looked
the coffin was empty
it was certainly a surprise to me and gave me a considerable shock but van helsing was unmoved
he was now more sure than ever of his ground and so emboldened to proceed in his task
are you satisfied now friend john
i felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as i answered him i am satisfied that lucys body is not in that coffin but that only proves one thing
and what is that friend john
that it is not there
that is good logic he said so far as it goes
but how do youhow can youaccount for it not being there
perhaps a bodysnatcher i suggested
some of the undertakers people may have stolen it
i felt that i was speaking folly and yet it was the only real cause which i could suggest
the professor sighed
ah well
he said we must have more proof
come with me
he put on the coffinlid again gathered up all his things and placed them in the bag blew out the light and placed the candle also in the bag
we opened the door and went out
behind us he closed the door and locked it
he handed me the key saying will you keep it
you had better be assured
i laughedit was not a very cheerful laugh i am bound to sayas i motioned him to keep it
a key is nothing i said there may be duplicates and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of that kind
he said nothing but put the key in his pocket
then he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the other
i took up my place behind a yewtree and i saw his dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight
it was a lonely vigil
just after i had taken my place i heard a distant clock strike twelve and in time came one and two
i was chilled and unnerved and angry with the professor for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming
i was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether i had a dreary miserable time
suddenly as i turned round i thought i saw something like a white streak moving between two dark yewtrees at the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb at the same time a dark mass moved from the professors side of the ground and hurriedly went towards it
then i too moved but i had to go round headstones and railedoff tombs and i stumbled over graves
the sky was overcast and somewhere far off an early cock crew
a little way off beyond a line of scattered junipertrees which marked the pathway to the church a white dim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb
the tomb itself was hidden by trees and i could not see where the figure disappeared
i heard the rustle of actual movement where i had first seen the white figure and coming over found the professor holding in his arms a tiny child
when he saw me he held it out to me and said are you satisfied now
no i said in a way that i felt was aggressive
do you not see the child
yes it is a child but who brought it here
and is it wounded
we shall see said the professor and with one impulse we took our way out of the churchyard he carrying the sleeping child
when we had got some little distance away we went into a clump of trees and struck a match and looked at the childs throat
it was without a scratch or scar of any kind
was i right
i asked triumphantly
we were just in time said the professor thankfully
we had now to decide what we were to do with the child and so consulted about it
if we were to take it to a policestation we should have to give some account of our movements during the night at least we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child
so finally we decided that we would take it to the heath and when we heard a policeman coming would leave it where he could not fail to find it we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could
all fell out well
at the edge of hampstead heath we heard a policemans heavy tramp and laying the child on the pathway we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro
we heard his exclamation of astonishment and then we went away silently
by good chance we got a cab near the spaniards and drove to town
i cannot sleep so i make this entry
but i must try to get a few hours sleep as van helsing is to call for me at noon
he insists that i shall go with him on another expedition
27 september
it was two oclock before we found a suitable opportunity for our attempt
the funeral held at noon was all completed and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away when looking carefully from behind a clump of aldertrees we saw the sexton lock the gate after him
we knew then that we were safe till morning did we desire it but the professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most
again i felt that horrid sense of the reality of things in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place and i realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work
besides i felt it was all so useless
outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again when we knew from the evidence of our own eyesight that the coffin was empty
i shrugged my shoulders however and rested silent for van helsing had a way of going on his own road no matter who remonstrated
he took the key opened the vault and again courteously motioned me to precede
the place was not so gruesome as last night but oh how unutterably meanlooking when the sunshine streamed in
van helsing walked over to lucys coffin and i followed
he bent over and again forced back the leaden flange and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me
there lay lucy seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her funeral
she was if possible more radiantly beautiful than ever and i could not believe that she was dead
the lips were red nay redder than before and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom
is this a juggle
i said to him
are you convinced now
said the professor in response and as he spoke he put over his hand and in a way that made me shudder pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth
see he went on see they are even sharper than before
with this and thisand he touched one of the canine teeth and that below itthe little children can be bitten
are you of belief now friend john
once more argumentative hostility woke within me
i could not accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested so with an attempt to argue of which i was even at the moment ashamed i said she may have been placed here since last night
indeed
that is so and by whom
i do not know
some one has done it
and yet she has been dead one week
most peoples in that time would not look so
i had no answer for this so was silent
van helsing did not seem to notice my silence at any rate he showed neither chagrin nor triumph
he was looking intently at the face of the dead woman raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth
then he turned to me and said here there is one thing which is different from all recorded here is some dual life that is not as the common
she was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance sleepwalkingoh you start you do not know that friend john but you shall know it all laterand in trance could he best come to take more blood
in trance she died and in trance she is undead too
so it is that she differ from all other
usually when the undead sleep at homeas he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was hometheir face show what they are but this so sweet that was when she not undead she go back to the nothings of the common dead
there is no malign there see and so it make hard that i must kill her in her sleep
this turned my blood cold and it began to dawn upon me that i was accepting van helsings theories but if she were really dead what was there of terror in the idea of killing her
he looked up at me and evidently saw the change in my face for he said almost joyously ah you believe now
i answered do not press me too hard all at once
i am willing to accept
how will you do this bloody work
i shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic and i shall drive a stake through her body
it made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman whom i had loved
and yet the feeling was not so strong as i had expected
i was in fact beginning to shudder at the presence of this being this undead as van helsing called it and to loathe it
is it possible that love is all subjective or all objective
i waited a considerable time for van helsing to begin but he stood as if wrapped in thought
presently he closed the catch of his bag with a snap and said i have been thinking and have made up my mind as to what is best
if i did simply follow my inclining i would do now at this moment what is to be done but there are other things to follow and things that are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know
this is simple
she have yet no life taken though that is of time and to act now would be to take danger from her for ever
but then we may have to want arthur and how shall we tell him of this
if you who saw the wounds on lucys throat and saw the wounds so similar on the childs at the hospital if you who saw the coffin empty last night and full today with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week after she dieif you know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard and yet of your own senses you did not believe how then can i expect arthur who know none of those things to believe
he doubted me when i took him from her kiss when she was dying
i know he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea i have done things that prevent him say goodbye as he ought and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive and that in most mistake of all we have killed her
he will then argue back that it is we mistaken ones that have killed her by our ideas and so he will be much unhappy always
yet he never can be sure and that is the worst of all
and he will sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered and again he will think that we may be right and that his so beloved was after all an undead
i told him once and since then i learn much
now since i know it is all true a hundred thousand times more do i know that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet
he poor fellow must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to him then we can act for good all round and send him peace
my mind is made up
let us go
you return home for tonight to your asylum and see that all be well
as for me i shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way
tomorrow night you will come to me to the berkeley hotel at ten of the clock
i shall send for arthur to come too and also that so fine young man of america that gave his blood
later we shall all have work to do
i come with you so far as piccadilly and there dine for i must be back here before the sun set
so we locked the tomb and came away and got over the wall of the churchyard which was not much of a task and drove back to piccadilly
note left by van helsing in his portmanteau berkeley hotel directed to john seward m
not delivered
friend john i write this in case anything should happen
i go alone to watch in that churchyard
it pleases me that the undead miss lucy shall not leave tonight that so on the morrow night she may be more eager
therefore i shall fix some things she like notgarlic and a crucifixand so seal up the door of the tomb
she is young as undead and will heed
moreover these are only to prevent her coming out they may not prevail on her wanting to get in for then the undead is desperate and must find the line of least resistance whatsoever it may be
i shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise and if there be aught that may be learned i shall learn it
for miss lucy or from her i have no fear but that other to whom is there that she is undead he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter
he is cunning as i know from mr jonathan and from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for miss lucys life and we lost and in many ways the undead are strong
he have always the strength in his hand of twenty men even we four who gave our strength to miss lucy it also is all to him
besides he can summon his wolf and i know not what
so if it be that he come thither on this night he shall find me but none other shalluntil it be too late
but it may be that he will not attempt the place
there is no reason why he should his hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the undead woman sleep and the one old man watch
therefore i write this in case
take the papers that are with this the diaries of harker and the rest and read them and then find this great undead and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake through it so that the world may rest from him
if it be so farewell
28 september
it is wonderful what a good nights sleep will do for one
yesterday i was almost willing to accept van helsings monstrous ideas but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on common sense
i have no doubt that he believes it all
i wonder if his mind can have become in any way unhinged
surely there must be some rational explanation of all these mysterious things
is it possible that the professor can have done it himself
he is so abnormally clever that if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way
i am loath to think it and indeed it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that van helsing was mad but anyhow i shall watch him carefully
i may get some light on the mystery
29 september morning
last night at a little before ten oclock arthur and quincey came into van helsings room he told us all that he wanted us to do but especially addressing himself to arthur as if all our wills were centred in his
he began by saying that he hoped we would all come with him too for he said there is a grave duty to be done there
you were doubtless surprised at my letter
this query was directly addressed to lord godalming
i was
it rather upset me for a bit
there has been so much trouble around my house of late that i could do without any more
i have been curious too as to what you mean
quincey and i talked it over but the more we talked the more puzzled we got till now i can say for myself that im about up a tree as to any meaning about anything
me too said quincey morris laconically
oh said the professor then you are nearer the beginning both of you than friend john here who has to go a long way back before he can even get so far as to begin
it was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of mind without my saying a word
then turning to the other two he said with intense gravity i want your permission to do what i think good this night
it is i know much to ask and when you know what it is i propose to do you will know and only then how much
therefore may i ask that you promise me in the dark so that afterwards though you may be angry with me for a timei must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may beyou shall not blame yourselves for anything
thats frank anyhow broke in quincey
ill answer for the professor
i dont quite see his drift but i swear hes honest and thats good enough for me
i thank you sir said van helsing proudly
i have done myself the honour of counting you one trusting friend and such endorsement is dear to me
he held out a hand which quincey took
then arthur spoke out dr van helsing i dont quite like to buy a pig in a poke as they say in scotland and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman or my faith as a christian is concerned i cannot make such a promise
if you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of these two then i give my consent at once though for the life of me i cannot understand what you are driving at
i accept your limitation said van helsing and all i ask of you is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine you will first consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your reservations
said arthur that is only fair
and now that the pourparlers are over may i ask what it is we are to do
i want you to come with me and to come in secret to the churchyard at kingstead
arthurs face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way where poor lucy is buried
the professor bowed
arthur went on and when there
to enter the tomb
arthur stood up
professor are you in earnest or it is some monstrous joke
pardon me i see that you are in earnest
he sat down again but i could see that he sat firmly and proudly as one who is on his dignity
there was silence until he asked again and when in the tomb
this is too much
he said angrily rising again
i am willing to be patient in all things that are reasonable but in thisthis desecration of the graveof one who he fairly choked with indignation
the professor looked pityingly at him
if i could spare you one pang my poor friend he said god knows i would
but this night our feet must tread in thorny paths or later and for ever the feet you love must walk in paths of flame
arthur looked up with set white face and said take care sir take care
would it not be well to hear what i have to say
and then you will at least know the limit of my purpose
shall i go on
thats fair enough broke in morris
after a pause van helsing went on evidently with an effort miss lucy is dead is it not so
then there can be no wrong to her
but if she be not dead arthur jumped to his feet
good god
he cried
has there been any mistake has she been buried alive
he groaned in anguish that not even hope could soften
i did not say she was alive my child i did not think it
i go no further than to say that she might be undead
undead
not alive
is this all a nightmare or what is it
there are mysteries which men can only guess at which age by age they may solve only in part
believe me we are now on the verge of one
but i have not done
may i cut off the head of dead miss lucy
heavens and earth no
cried arthur in a storm of passion
not for the wide world will i consent to any mutilation of her dead body
dr van helsing you try me too far
what have i done to you that you should torture me so
what did that poor sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave
are you mad to speak such things or am i mad to listen to them
dont dare to think more of such a desecration i shall not give my consent to anything you do
i have a duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage and by god i shall do it
van helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated and said gravely and sternly my lord godalming i too have a duty to do a duty to others a duty to you a duty to the dead and by god i shall do it
all i ask you now is that you come with me that you look and listen and if when later i make the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfilment even than i am thenthen i shall do my duty whatever it may seem to me
and then to follow of your lordships wishes i shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you when and where you will
his voice broke a little and he went on with a voice full of pity but i beseech you do not go forth in anger with me
in a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do and which sometimes did wring my heart i have never had so heavy a task as now
believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour for i would do what a man can to save you from sorrow
just think
for why should i give myself so much of labour and so much of sorrow
i have come here from my own land to do what i can of good at the first to please my friend john and then to help a sweet young lady whom too i came to love
for heri am ashamed to say so much but i say it in kindnessi gave what you gave the blood of my veins i gave it i who was not like you her lover but only her physician and her friend
i gave to her my nights and daysbefore death after death and if my death can do her good even now when she is the dead undead she shall have it freely
he said this with a very grave sweet pride and arthur was much affected by it
he took the old mans hand and said in a broken voice oh it is hard to think of it and i cannot understand but at least i shall go with you and wait
the night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across the sky
we all kept somehow close together with van helsing slightly in front as he led the way
when we had come close to the tomb i looked well at arthur for i feared that the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset him but he bore himself well
i took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief
the professor unlocked the door and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons solved the difficulty by entering first himself
the rest of us followed and he closed the door
he then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin
arthur stepped forward hesitatingly van helsing said to me you were with me here yesterday
was the body of miss lucy in that coffin
it was
the professor turned to the rest saying you hear and yet there is no one who does not believe with me
he took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin
arthur looked on very pale but silent when the lid was removed he stepped forward
he evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin or at any rate had not thought of it
when he saw the rent in the lead the blood rushed to his face for an instant but as quickly fell away again so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness he was still silent
van helsing forced back the leaden flange and we all looked in and recoiled
for several minutes no one spoke a word
the silence was broken by quincey morris professor i answered for you
your word is all i want
i wouldnt ask such a thing ordinarilyi wouldnt so dishonour you as to imply a doubt but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour
is this your doing
i swear to you by all that i hold sacred that i have not removed nor touched her
what happened was this two nights ago my friend seward and i came herewith good purpose believe me
i opened that coffin which was then sealed up and we found it as now empty
we then waited and saw something white come through the trees
the next day we came here in daytime and she lay there
did she not friend john
that night we were just in time
one more so small child was missing and we find it thank god unharmed amongst the graves
yesterday i came here before sundown for at sundown the undead can move
i waited here all the night till the sun rose but i saw nothing
it was most probable that it was because i had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic which the undead cannot bear and other things which they shun
last night there was no exodus so tonight before the sundown i took away my garlic and other things
and so it is we find this coffin empty
but bear with me
so far there is much that is strange
wait you with me outside unseen and unheard and things much stranger are yet to be
sohere he shut the dark slide of his lanternnow to the outside
he opened the door and we filed out he coming last and locking the door behind him
but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault
how sweet it was to see the clouds race by and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passinglike the gladness and sorrow of a mans life how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air that had no taint of death and decay how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city
each in his own way was solemn and overcome
arthur was silent and was i could see striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery
i was myself tolerably patient and half inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept van helsings conclusions
quincey morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery with hazard of all he has to stake
not being able to smoke he cut himself a goodsized plug of tobacco and began to chew
as to van helsing he was employed in a definite way
first he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin waferlike biscuit which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin next he took out a doublehandful of some whitish stuff like dough or putty
he crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands
this he then took and rolling it into thin strips began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb
i was somewhat puzzled at this and being close asked him what it was that he was doing
arthur and quincey drew near also as they too were curious
he answered i am closing the tomb so that the undead may not enter
and is that stuff you have put there going to do it
asked quincey
great scott
is this a game
it is
what is that which you are using
this time the question was by arthur
van helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered the host
i brought it from amsterdam
i have an indulgence
it was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the professors a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things it was impossible to distrust
in respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb but hidden from the sight of any one approaching
i pitied the others especially arthur
i had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror and yet i who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs felt my heart sink within me
never did tombs look so ghastly white never did cypress or yew or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously never did bough creak so mysteriously and never did the faraway howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night
there was a long spell of silence a big aching void and then from the professor a keen ssss
he pointed and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advancea dim white figure which held something dark at its breast
the figure stopped and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence a darkhaired woman dressed in the cerements of the grave
we could not see the face for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fairhaired child
there was a pause and a sharp little cry such as a child gives in sleep or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams
we were starting forward but the professors warning hand seen by us as he stood behind a yewtree kept us back and then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again
it was now near enough for us to see clearly and the moonlight still held
my own heart grew cold as ice and i could hear the gasp of arthur as we recognised the features of lucy westenra
lucy westenra but yet how changed
the sweetness was turned to adamantine heartless cruelty and the purity to voluptuous wantonness
van helsing stepped out and obedient to his gesture we all advanced too the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb
van helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide by the concentrated light that fell on lucys face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood and that the stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn deathrobe
we shuddered with horror
i could see by the tremulous light that even van helsings iron nerve had failed
arthur was next to me and if i had not seized his arm and held him up he would have fallen
when lucyi call the thing that was before us lucy because it bore her shapesaw us she drew back with an angry snarl such as a cat gives when taken unawares then her eyes ranged over us
lucys eyes in form and colour but lucys eyes unclean and full of hellfire instead of the pure gentle orbs we knew
at that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing had she then to be killed i could have done it with savage delight
as she looked her eyes blazed with unholy light and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile
oh god how it made me shudder to see it
with a careless motion she flung to the ground callous as a devil the child that up to now she had clutched strenuously to her breast growling over it as a dog growls over a bone
the child gave a sharp cry and lay there moaning
there was a coldbloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from arthur when she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his hands
she still advanced however and with a languorous voluptuous grace said come to me arthur
leave these others and come to me
my arms are hungry for you
come and we can rest together
come my husband come
there was something diabolically sweet in her tonessomething of the tingling of glass when struckwhich rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another
as for arthur he seemed under a spell moving his hands from his face he opened wide his arms
she was leaping for them when van helsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix
she recoiled from it and with a suddenly distorted face full of rage dashed past him as if to enter the tomb
when within a foot or two of the door however she stopped as if arrested by some irresistible force
then she turned and her face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp which had now no quiver from van helsings iron nerves
never did i see such baffled malice on a face and never i trust shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes
the beautiful colour became livid the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hellfire the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of medusas snakes and the lovely bloodstained mouth grew to an open square as in the passion masks of the greeks and japanese
if ever a face meant deathif looks could killwe saw it at that moment
and so for full half a minute which seemed an eternity she remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of entry
van helsing broke the silence by asking arthur answer me oh my friend
am i to proceed in my work
arthur threw himself on his knees and hid his face in his hands as he answered do as you will friend do as you will
there can be no horror like this ever any more and he groaned in spirit
quincey and i simultaneously moved towards him and took his arms
we could hear the click of the closing lantern as van helsing held it down coming close to the tomb he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there
we all looked on in horrified amazement as we saw when he stood back the woman with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own pass in through the interstice where scarce a knifeblade could have gone
we all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the professor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door
when this was done he lifted the child and said come now my friends we can do no more till tomorrow
there is a funeral at noon so here we shall all come before long after that
the friends of the dead will all be gone by two and when the sexton lock the gate we shall remain
then there is more to do but not like this of tonight
as for this little one he is not much harm and by tomorrow night he shall be well
we shall leave him where the police will find him as on the other night and then to home
coming close to arthur he said my friend arthur you have had a sore trial but after when you look back you will see how it was necessary
you are now in the bitter waters my child
by this time tomorrow you will please god have passed them and have drunk of the sweet waters so do not mourn overmuch
till then i shall not ask you to forgive me
arthur and quincey came home with me and we tried to cheer each other on the way
we had left the child in safety and were tired so we all slept with more or less reality of sleep
29 september night
a little before twelve oclock we threearthur quincey morris and myselfcalled for the professor
it was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes
of course arthur wore black for he was in deep mourning but the rest of us wore it by instinct
we got to the churchyard by halfpast one and strolled about keeping out of official observation so that when the gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief that every one had gone had locked the gate we had the place all to ourselves
van helsing instead of his little black bag had with him a long leather one something like a cricketing bag it was manifestly of fair weight
when we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the road we silently and as if by ordered intention followed the professor to the tomb
he unlocked the door and we entered closing it behind us
then he took from his bag the lantern which he lit and also two wax candles which when lighted he stuck by melting their own ends on other coffins so that they might give light sufficient to work by
when he again lifted the lid off lucys coffin we all lookedarthur trembling like an aspenand saw that the body lay there in all its deathbeauty
but there was no love in my own heart nothing but loathing for the foul thing which had taken lucys shape without her soul
i could see even arthurs face grow hard as he looked
presently he said to van helsing is this really lucys body or only a demon in her shape
it is her body and yet not it
but wait a while and you all see her as she was and is
she seemed like a nightmare of lucy as she lay there the pointed teeth the bloodstained voluptuous mouthwhich it made one shudder to seethe whole carnal and unspiritual appearance seeming like a devilish mockery of lucys sweet purity
van helsing with his usual methodicalness began taking the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use
first he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder and then a small oillamp which gave out when lit in a corner of the tomb gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame then his operating knives which he placed to hand and last a round wooden stake some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long
one end of it was hardened by charring in the fire and was sharpened to a fine point
with this stake came a heavy hammer such as in households is used in the coalcellar for breaking the lumps
to me a doctors preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing but the effect of these things on both arthur and quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation
they both however kept their courage and remained silent and quiet
when all was ready van helsing said before we do anything let me tell you this it is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the undead
when they become such there comes with the change the curse of immortality they cannot die but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world for all that die from the preying of the undead becomes themselves undead and prey on their kind
and so the circle goes on ever widening like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water
friend arthur if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor lucy die or again last night when you open your arms to her you would in time when you had died have become nosferatu as they call it in eastern europe and would all time make more of those undeads that so have fill us with horror
the career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun
those children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse but if she live on undead more and more they lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her and so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth
but if she die in truth then all cease the tiny wounds of the throats disappear and they go back to their plays unknowing ever of what has been
but of the most blessed of all when this now undead be made to rest as true dead then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free
instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day she shall take her place with the other angels
so that my friend it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free
to this i am willing but is there none amongst us who has a better right
will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not it was my hand that sent her to the stars it was the hand of him that loved her best the hand that of all she would herself have chosen had it been to her to choose
tell me if there be such a one amongst us
we all looked at arthur
he saw too what we all did the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore lucy to us as a holy and not an unholy memory he stepped forward and said bravely though his hand trembled and his face was as pale as snow my true friend from the bottom of my broken heart i thank you
tell me what i am to do and i shall not falter
van helsing laid a hand on his shoulder and said brave lad
a moments courage and it is done
this stake must be driven through her
it will be a fearful ordealbe not deceived in thatbut it will be only a short time and you will then rejoice more than your pain was great from this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air
but you must not falter when once you have begun
only think that we your true friends are round you and that we pray for you all the time
go on said arthur hoarsely
tell me what i am to do
take this stake in your left hand ready to place the point over the heart and the hammer in your right
then when we begin our prayer for the deadi shall read him i have here the book and the others shall followstrike in gods name that so all may be well with the dead that we love and that the undead pass away
arthur took the stake and the hammer and when once his mind was set on action his hands never trembled nor even quivered
van helsing opened his missal and began to read and quincey and i followed as well as we could
arthur placed the point over the heart and as i looked i could see its dint in the white flesh
then he struck with all his might
the thing in the coffin writhed and a hideous bloodcurdling screech came from the opened red lips
the body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions the sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam
but arthur never faltered
he looked like a figure of thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell driving deeper and deeper the mercybearing stake whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it
his face was set and high duty seemed to shine through it the sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little vault
and then the writhing and quivering of the body became less and the teeth seemed to champ and the face to quiver
finally it lay still
the terrible task was over
the hammer fell from arthurs hand
he reeled and would have fallen had we not caught him
the great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead and his breath came in broken gasps
it had indeed been an awful strain on him and had he not been forced to his task by more than human considerations he could never have gone through with it
for a few minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the coffin
when we did however a murmur of startled surprise ran from one to the other of us
we gazed so eagerly that arthur rose for he had been seated on the ground and came and looked too and then a glad strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it
there in the coffin lay no longer the foul thing that we had so dreaded and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a privilege to the one best entitled to it but lucy as we had seen her in her life with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity
true that there were there as we had seen them in life the traces of care and pain and waste but these were all dear to us for they marked her truth to what we knew
one and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever
van helsing came and laid his hand on arthurs shoulder and said to him and now arthur my friend dear lad am i not forgiven
the reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old mans hand in his and raising it to his lips pressed it and said forgiven
god bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again and me peace
he put his hands on the professors shoulder and laying his head on his breast cried for a while silently whilst we stood unmoving
when he raised his head van helsing said to him and now my child you may kiss her
kiss her dead lips if you will as she would have you to if for her to choose
for she is not a grinning devil nownot any more a foul thing for all eternity
no longer she is the devils undead
she is gods true dead whose soul is with him
arthur bent and kissed her and then we sent him and quincey out of the tomb the professor and i sawed the top off the stake leaving the point of it in the body
then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with garlic
we soldered up the leaden coffin screwed on the coffinlid and gathering up our belongings came away
when the professor locked the door he gave the key to arthur
outside the air was sweet the sun shone and the birds sang and it seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch
there was gladness and mirth and peace everywhere for we were at rest ourselves on one account and we were glad though it was with a tempered joy
before we moved away van helsing said now my friends one step of our work is done one the most harrowing to ourselves
but there remains a greater task to find out the author of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out
i have clues which we can follow but it is a long task and a difficult and there is danger in it and pain
shall you not all help me
we have learned to believe all of usis it not so
and since so do we not see our duty
and do we not promise to go on to the bitter end
each in turn we took his hand and the promise was made
then said the professor as we moved off two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of the clock with friend john
i shall entreat two others two that you know not as yet and i shall be ready to all our work show and our plans unfold
friend john you come with me home for i have much to consult about and you can help me
tonight i leave for amsterdam but shall return tomorrow night
and then begins our great quest
but first i shall have much to say so that you may know what is to do and to dread
then our promise shall be made to each other anew for there is a terrible task before us and once our feet are on the ploughshare we must not draw back
jonathan at whitby
important news
mina harker
the professor was delighted
ah that wonderful madam mina he said pearl among women
she arrive but i cannot stay
she must go to your house friend john
you must meet her at the station
telegraph her en route so that she may be prepared
when the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea over it he told me of a diary kept by jonathan harker when abroad and gave me a typewritten copy of it as also of mr
harkers diary at whitby
take these he said and study them well
when i have returned you will be master of all the facts and we can then better enter on our inquisition
keep them safe for there is in them much of treasure
you will need all your faith even you who have had such an experience as that of today
what is here told he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of papers as he spoke may be the beginning of the end to you and me and many another or it may sound the knell of the undead who walk the earth
read all i pray you with the open mind and if you can add in any way to the story here told do so for it is allimportant
you have kept diary of all these so strange things is it not so
then we shall go through all these together when we meet
he then made ready for his departure and shortly after drove off to liverpool street
i took my way to paddington where i arrived about fifteen minutes before the train came in
the crowd melted away after the bustling fashion common to arrival platforms and i was beginning to feel uneasy lest i might miss my guest when a sweetfaced daintylooking girl stepped up to me and after a quick glance said dr seward is it not
and you are mr
i answered at once whereupon she held out her hand
i knew you from the description of poor dear lucy but she stopped suddenly and a quick blush overspread her face
the blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease for it was a tacit answer to her own
i got her luggage which included a typewriter and we took the underground to fenchurch street after i had sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sittingroom and bedroom prepared at once for mr
in due time we arrived
she knew of course that the place was a lunatic asylum but i could see that she was unable to repress a shudder when we entered
she told me that if she might she would come presently to my study as she had much to say
so here i am finishing my entry in my phonograph diary whilst i await her
as yet i have not had the chance of looking at the papers which van helsing left with me though they lie open before me
i must get her interested in something so that i may have an opportunity of reading them
she does not know how precious time is or what a task we have in hand
i must be careful not to frighten her
here she is
29 september
after i had tidied myself i went down to dr sewards study
at the door i paused a moment for i thought i heard him talking with some one
as however he had pressed me to be quick i knocked at the door and on his calling out come in i entered
to my intense surprise there was no one with him
he was quite alone and on the table opposite him was what i knew at once from the description to be a phonograph
i had never seen one and was much interested
i hope i did not keep you waiting i said but i stayed at the door as i heard you talking and thought there was some one with you
oh he replied with a smile i was only entering my diary
your diary
i asked him in surprise
yes he answered
i keep it in this
as he spoke he laid his hand on the phonograph
i felt quite excited over it and blurted out why this beats even shorthand
may i hear it say something
certainly he replied with alacrity and stood up to put it in train for speaking
then he paused and a troubled look overspread his face
the fact is he began awkwardly i only keep my diary in it and as it is entirelyalmost entirelyabout my cases it may be awkwardthat is i mean he stopped and i tried to help him out of his embarrassment you helped to attend dear lucy at the end
let me hear how she died for all that i know of her i shall be very grateful
she was very very dear to me
to my surprise he answered with a horrorstruck look in his face tell you of her death
not for the wide world
i asked for some grave terrible feeling was coming over me
again he paused and i could see that he was trying to invent an excuse
at length he stammered out you see i do not know how to pick out any particular part of the diary
even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him and he said with unconscious simplicity in a different voice and with the navet of a child thats quite true upon my honour
honest indian
i could not but smile at which he grimaced
i gave myself away that time
but do you know that although i have kept the diary for months past it never once struck me how i was going to find any particular part of it in case i wanted to look it up
by this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who attended lucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible being and i said boldly then dr seward you had better let me copy it out for you on my typewriter
he grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said no
for all the world i wouldnt let you know that terrible story
then it was terrible my intuition was right
for a moment i thought and as my eyes ranged the room unconsciously looking for something or some opportunity to aid me they lit on a great batch of typewriting on the table
his eyes caught the look in mine and without his thinking followed their direction
as they saw the parcel he realised my meaning
you do not know me i said
when you have read those papersmy own diary and my husbands also which i have typedyou will know me better
i have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in this cause but of course you do not know meyet and i must not expect you to trust me so far
he is certainly a man of noble nature poor dear lucy was right about him
he stood up and opened a large drawer in which were arranged in order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax and said you are quite right
i did not trust you because i did not know you
but i know you now and let me say that i should have known you long ago
i know that lucy told you of me she told me of you too
may i make the only atonement in my power
take the cylinders and hear themthe first halfdozen of them are personal to me and they will not horrify you then you will know me better
dinner will by then be ready
in the meantime i shall read over some of these documents and shall be better able to understand certain things
he carried the phonograph himself up to my sittingroom and adjusted it for me
now i shall learn something pleasant i am sure for it will tell me the other side of a true love episode of which i know one side already
i was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of jonathan harker and that other of his wife that i let the time run on without thinking
harker was not down when the maid came to announce dinner so i said she is possibly tired let dinner wait an hour and i went on with my work
i had just finished mr
harkers diary when she came in
she looked sweetly pretty but very sad and her eyes were flushed with crying
this somehow moved me much
of late i have had cause for tears god knows
but the relief of them was denied me and now the sight of those sweet eyes brightened with recent tears went straight to my heart
so i said as gently as i could i greatly fear i have distressed you
oh no not distressed me she replied but i have been more touched than i can say by your grief
that is a wonderful machine but it is cruelly true
it told me in its very tones the anguish of your heart
it was like a soul crying out to almighty god
no one must hear them spoken ever again
see i have tried to be useful
i have copied out the words on my typewriter and none other need now hear your heart beat as i did
no one need ever know shall ever know i said in a low voice
she laid her hand on mine and said very gravely ah but they must
must
but why
because it is a part of the terrible story a part of poor dear lucys death and all that led to it because in the struggle which we have before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get
i think that the cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know but i can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark mystery
you will let me help will you not
i know all up to a certain point and i see already though your diary only took me to 7 september how poor lucy was beset and how her terrible doom was being wrought out
jonathan and i have been working day and night since professor van helsing saw us
he is gone to whitby to get more information and he will be here tomorrow to help us
we need have no secrets amongst us working together and with absolute trust we can surely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark
she looked at me so appealingly and at the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing that i gave in at once to her wishes
you shall i said do as you like in the matter
god forgive me if i do wrong
there are terrible things yet to learn of but if you have so far travelled on the road to poor lucys death you will not be content i know to remain in the dark
nay the endthe very endmay give you a gleam of peace
come there is dinner
we must keep one another strong for what is before us we have a cruel and dreadful task
when you have eaten you shall learn the rest and i shall answer any questions you askif there be anything which you do not understand though it was apparent to us who were present
after dinner i came with dr seward to his study
he brought back the phonograph from my room and i took my typewriter
he placed me in a comfortable chair and arranged the phonograph so that i could touch it without getting up and showed me how to stop it in case i should want to pause
then he very thoughtfully took a chair with his back to me so that i might be as free as possible and began to read
i put the forked metal to my ears and listened
when the terrible story of lucys death andand all that followed was done i lay back in my chair powerless
fortunately i am not of a fainting disposition
when dr seward saw me he jumped up with a horrified exclamation and hurriedly taking a casebottle from a cupboard gave me some brandy which in a few minutes somewhat restored me
my brain was all in a whirl and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors the holy ray of light that my dear dear lucy was at last at peace i do not think i could have borne it without making a scene
it is all so wild and mysterious and strange that if i had not known jonathans experience in transylvania i could not have believed
as it was i didnt know what to believe and so got out of my difficulty by attending to something else
i took the cover off my typewriter and said to dr seward let me write this all out now
we must be ready for dr van helsing when he comes
i have sent a telegram to jonathan to come on here when he arrives in london from whitby
in this matter dates are everything and i think that if we get all our material ready and have every item put in chronological order we shall have done much
you tell me that lord godalming and mr morris are coming too
let us be able to tell him when they come
he accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace and i began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder
i used manifold and so took three copies of the diary just as i had done with all the rest
it was late when i got through but dr seward went about his work of going his round of the patients when he had finished he came back and sat near me reading so that i did not feel too lonely whilst i worked
how good and thoughtful he is the world seems full of good meneven if there are monsters in it
before i left him i remembered what jonathan put in his diary of the professors perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at exeter so seeing that dr seward keeps his newspapers i borrowed the files of the westminster gazette and the pall mall gazette and took them to my room
i remember how much the dailygraph and the whitby gazette of which i had made cuttings helped us to understand the terrible events at whitby when count dracula landed so i shall look through the evening papers since then and perhaps i shall get some new light
i am not sleepy and the work will help to keep me quiet
30 september
mr harker arrived at nine oclock
he had got his wifes wire just before starting
he is uncommonly clever if one can judge from his face and full of energy
if this journal be trueand judging by ones own wonderful experiences it must behe is also a man of great nerve
that going down to the vault a second time was a remarkable piece of daring
after reading his account of it i was prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood but hardly the quiet businesslike gentleman who came here today
after lunch harker and his wife went back to their own room and as i passed a while ago i heard the click of the typewriter
they are hard at it
harker says that they are knitting together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have
harker has got the letters between the consignee of the boxes at whitby and the carriers in london who took charge of them
he is now reading his wifes typescript of my diary
i wonder what they make out of it
here it is
strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be the counts hidingplace
goodness knows that we had enough clues from the conduct of the patient renfield
the bundle of letters relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript
oh if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor lucy
stop that way madness lies
harker has gone back and is again collating his material
he says that by dinnertime they will be able to show a whole connected narrative
he thinks that in the meantime i should see renfield as hitherto he has been a sort of index to the coming and going of the count
i hardly see this yet but when i get at the dates i suppose i shall
what a good thing that mr
harker put my cylinders into type
we never could have found the dates otherwise
i found renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded smiling benignly
at the moment he seemed as sane as any one i ever saw
i sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects all of which he treated naturally
he then of his own accord spoke of going home a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn here
in fact he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge at once
i believe that had i not had the chat with harker and read the letters and the dates of his outbursts i should have been prepared to sign for him after a brief time of observation
as it is i am darkly suspicious
all those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the count
what then does this absolute content mean
can it be that his instinct is satisfied as to the vampires ultimate triumph
stay he is himself zophagous and in his wild ravings outside the chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of master
this all seems confirmation of our idea
however after a while i came away my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it safe to probe him too deep with questions
he might begin to think and then
so i came away
i mistrust these quiet moods of his so i have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him and to have a straitwaistcoat ready in case of need
29 september in train to london
when i received mr billingtons courteous message that he would give me any information in his power i thought it best to go down to whitby and make on the spot such inquiries as i wanted
it was now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the counts to its place in london
later we may be able to deal with it
billington junior a nice lad met me at the station and brought me to his fathers house where they had decided that i must stay the night
they are hospitable with true yorkshire hospitality give a guest everything and leave him free to do as he likes
they all knew that i was busy and that my stay was short and mr billington had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes
it gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which i had seen on the counts table before i knew of his diabolical plans
everything had been carefully thought out and done systematically and with precision
he seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried out
to use an americanism he had taken no chances and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled was simply the logical result of his care
i saw the invoice and took note of it fifty cases of common earth to be used for experimental purposes
also the copy of letter to carter paterson and their reply of both of these i got copies
this was all the information mr billington could give me so i went down to the port and saw the coastguards the customs officers and the harbourmaster
they had all something to say of the strange entry of the ship which is already taking its place in local tradition but no one could add to the simple description fifty cases of common earth
i then saw the stationmaster who kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes
their tally was exact with the list and they had nothing to add except that the boxes were main and mortal heavy and that shifting them was dry work
one of them added that it was hard lines that there wasnt any gentleman suchlike as yourself squire to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it
needless to add i took care before leaving to lift for ever and adequately this source of reproach
the stationmaster was good enough to give me a line to his old companion the stationmaster at kings cross so that when i arrived there in the morning i was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes
he too put me at once in communication with the proper officials and i saw that their tally was correct with the original invoice
the opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited a noble use of them had however been made and again i was compelled to deal with the result in an ex post facto manner
from thence i went on to carter patersons central office where i met with the utmost courtesy
they looked up the transaction in their daybook and letterbook and at once telephoned to their kings cross office for more details
by good fortune the men who did the teaming were waiting for work and the official at once sent them over sending also by one of them the waybill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at carfax
here again i found the tally agreeing exactly the carriers men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words with a few details
these were i shortly found connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job and of the consequent thirst engendered in the operators
on my affording an opportunity through the medium of the currency of the realm of the allaying at a later period this beneficial evil one of the men remarked that ere ouse guvnor is the rummiest i ever was in
blyme
but it aint been touched sence a hundred years
there was dust that thick in the place that you might have slep on it without urtin of yer bones an the place was that neglected that yer might ave smelled ole jerusalem in it
but the ole chapelthat took the cike that did
me and my mate we thort we wouldnt never git out quick enough
lor i wouldnt take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark
having been in the house i could well believe him but if he knew what i know he would i think have raised his terms
of one thing i am now satisfied that all the boxes which arrived at whitby from varna in the demeter were safely deposited in the old chapel at carfax
there should be fifty of them there unless any have since been removedas from dr sewards diary i fear
i shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from carfax when renfield attacked them
by following up this clue we may learn a good deal
mina and i have worked all day and we have put all the papers into order
mina harkers journal 30 september
i am so glad that i hardly know how to contain myself
it is i suppose the reaction from the haunting fear which i have had that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act detrimentally on jonathan
i saw him leave for whitby with as brave a face as i could but i was sick with apprehension
the effort has however done him good
he was never so resolute never so strong never so full of volcanic energy as at present
it is just as that dear good professor van helsing said he is true grit and he improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature
he came back full of life and hope and determination we have got everything in order for tonight
i feel myself quite wild with excitement
i suppose one ought to pity any thing so hunted as is the count
that is just it this thing is not humannot even beast
to read dr sewards account of poor lucys death and what followed is enough to dry up the springs of pity in ones heart
lord godalming and mr morris arrived earlier than we expected
dr seward was out on business and had taken jonathan with him so i had to see them
it was to me a painful meeting for it brought back all poor dear lucys hopes of only a few months ago
of course they had heard lucy speak of me and it seemed that dr van helsing too has been quite blowing my trumpet as mr morris expressed it
poor fellows neither of them is aware that i know all about the proposals they made to lucy
they did not quite know what to say or do as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge so they had to keep on neutral subjects
however i thought the matter over and came to the conclusion that the best thing i could do would be to post them in affairs right up to date
i knew from dr sewards diary that they had been at lucys deathher real deathand that i need not fear to betray any secret before the time
so i told them as well as i could that i had read all the papers and diaries and that my husband and i having typewritten them had just finished putting them in order
i gave them each a copy to read in the library
when lord godalming got his and turned it overit does make a pretty good pilehe said did you write all this mr
i nodded and he went on i dont quite see the drift of it but you people are all so good and kind and have been working so earnestly and so energetically that all i can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you
i have had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble to the last hour of his life
besides i know you loved my poor lucy here he turned away and covered his face with his hands
i could hear the tears in his voice
mr morris with instinctive delicacy just laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder and then walked quietly out of the room
i suppose there is something in womans nature that makes a man free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood for when lord godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly
i sat down beside him and took his hand
i hope he didnt think it forward of me and that if he ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a thought
there i wrong him i know he never willhe is too true a gentleman
i said to him for i could see that his heart was breaking i loved dear lucy and i know what she was to you and what you were to her
she and i were like sisters and now she is gone will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble
i know what sorrows you have had though i cannot measure the depth of them
if sympathy and pity can help in your affliction wont you let me be of some little servicefor lucys sake
in an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief
it seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a vent at once
he grew quite hysterical and raising his open hands beat his palms together in a perfect agony of grief
he stood up and then sat down again and the tears rained down his cheeks
i felt an infinite pity for him and opened my arms unthinkingly
with a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child whilst he shook with emotion
we women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the motherspirit is invoked i felt this big sorrowing mans head resting on me as though it were that of the baby that some day may lie on my bosom and i stroked his hair as though he were my own child
i never thought at the time how strange it all was
after a little bit his sobs ceased and he raised himself with an apology though he made no disguise of his emotion
he told me that for days and nights pastweary days and sleepless nightshe had been unable to speak with any one as a man must speak in his time of sorrow
there was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him or with whom owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded he could speak freely
i know now how i suffered he said as he dried his eyes but i do not know even yetand none other can ever knowhow much your sweet sympathy has been to me today
i shall know better in time and believe me that though i am not ungrateful now my gratitude will grow with my understanding
you will let me be like a brother will you not for all our livesfor dear lucys sake
for dear lucys sake i said as we clasped hands
ay and for your own sake he added for if a mans esteem and gratitude are ever worth the winning you have won mine today
if ever the future should bring to you a time when you need a mans help believe me you will not call in vain
god grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the sunshine of your life but if it should ever come promise me that you will let me know
he was so earnest and his sorrow was so fresh that i felt it would comfort him so i said i promise
as i came along the corridor i saw mr morris looking out of a window
he turned as he heard my footsteps
how is art
then noticing my red eyes he went on ah i see you have been comforting him
he needs it
no one but a woman can help a man when he is in trouble of the heart and he had no one to comfort him
he bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him
i saw the manuscript in his hand and i knew that when he read it he would realise how much i knew so i said to him i wish i could comfort all who suffer from the heart
will you let me be your friend and will you come to me for comfort if you need it
you will know later on why i speak
he saw that i was in earnest and stooping took my hand and raising it to his lips kissed it
it seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul and impulsively i bent over and kissed him
the tears rose in his eyes and there was a momentary choking in his throat he said quite calmly little girl you will never regret that truehearted kindness so long as ever you live
then he went into the study to his friend
little girl
the very words he had used to lucy and oh but he proved himself a friend
i got home at five oclock and found that godalming and morris had not only arrived but had already studied the transcript of the various diaries and letters which harker and his wonderful wife had made and arranged
harker had not yet returned from his visit to the carriers men of whom dr hennessey had written to me
harker gave us a cup of tea and i can honestly say that for the first time since i have lived in it this old house seemed like home
when we had finished mr
harker said dr seward may i ask a favour
i want to see your patient mr renfield
do let me see him
what you have said of him in your diary interests me so much
she looked so appealing and so pretty that i could not refuse her and there was no possible reason why i should so i took her with me
when i went into the room i told the man that a lady would like to see him to which he simply answered why
she is going through the house and wants to see every one in it i answered
oh very well he said let her come in by all means but just wait a minute till i tidy up the place
his method of tidying was peculiar he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before i could stop him
it was quite evident that he feared or was jealous of some interference
when he had got through his disgusting task he said cheerfully let the lady come in and sat down on the edge of his bed with his head down but with his eyelids raised so that he could see her as she entered
for a moment i thought that he might have some homicidal intent i remembered how quiet he had been just before he attacked me in my own study and i took care to stand where i could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her
she came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunaticfor easiness is one of the qualities mad people most respect
she walked over to him smiling pleasantly and held out her hand
goodevening mr renfield said she
you see i know you for dr seward has told me of you
he made no immediate reply but eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face
this look gave way to one of wonder which merged in doubt then to my intense astonishment he said youre not the girl the doctor wanted to marry are you
you cant be you know for shes dead
harker smiled sweetly as she replied oh no
i have a husband of my own to whom i was married before i ever saw dr seward or he me
i am mr
then what are you doing here
my husband and i are staying on a visit with dr seward
then dont stay
but why not
i thought that this style of conversation might not be pleasant to mr
harker any more than it was to me so i joined in how did you know i wanted to marry any one
his reply was simply contemptuous given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from mr
harker to me instantly turning them back again what an asinine question
i dont see that at all mr renfield said mr
harker at once championing me
he replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as he had shown contempt to me you will of course understand mr
harker that when a man is so loved and honoured as our host is everything regarding him is of interest in our little community
dr seward is loved not only by his household and his friends but even by his patients who being some of them hardly in mental equilibrium are apt to distort causes and effects
since i myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum i cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors of non causa and ignoratio elenchi
i positively opened my eyes at this new development
here was my own pet lunaticthe most pronounced of his type that i had ever met withtalking elemental philosophy and with the manner of a polished gentleman
i wonder if it was mr
harkers presence which had touched some chord in his memory
if this new phase was spontaneous or in any way due to her unconscious influence she must have some rare gift or power
we continued to talk for some time and seeing that he was seemingly quite reasonable she ventured looking at me questioningly as she began to lead him to his favourite topic
i was again astonished for he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the completest sanity he even took himself as an example when he mentioned certain things
why i myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief
indeed it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed and insisted on my being put under control
i used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity and that by consuming a multitude of live things no matter how low in the scale of creation one might indefinitely prolong life
at times i held the belief so strongly that i actually tried to take human life
the doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion i tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his bloodrelying of course upon the scriptural phrase for the blood is the life
though indeed the vendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt
isnt that true doctor
i nodded assent for i was so amazed that i hardly knew what to either think or say it was hard to imagine that i had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes before
looking at my watch i saw that i should go to the station to meet van helsing so i told mr
harker that it was time to leave
she came at once after saying pleasantly to mr renfield goodbye and i hope i may see you often under auspices pleasanter to yourself to which to my astonishment he replied goodbye my dear
i pray god i may never see your sweet face again
may he bless and keep you
when i went to the station to meet van helsing i left the boys behind me
poor art seemed more cheerful than he has been since lucy first took ill and quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for many a long day
van helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a boy
he saw me at once and rushed up to me saying ah friend john how goes all
i have been busy for i come here to stay if need be
all affairs are settled with me and i have much to tell
madam mina is with you
and her so fine husband
and arthur and my friend quincey they are with you too
as i drove to the house i told him of what had passed and of how my own diary had come to be of some use through mr
harkers suggestion at which the professor interrupted me ah that wonderful madam mina
she has mans braina brain that a man should have were he much giftedand a womans heart
the good god fashioned her for a purpose believe me when he made that so good combination
friend john up to now fortune has made that woman of help to us after tonight she must not have to do with this so terrible affair
it is not good that she run a risk so great
we men are determinednay are we not pledged
to destroy this monster but it is no part for a woman
even if she be not harmed her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors and hereafter she may sufferboth in waking from her nerves and in sleep from her dreams
and besides she is young woman and not so long married there may be other things to think of some time if not now
you tell me she has wrote all then she must consult with us but tomorrow she say goodbye to this work and we go alone
i agreed heartily with him and then i told him what we had found in his absence that the house which dracula had bought was the very next one to my own
he was amazed and a great concern seemed to come on him
oh that we had known it before
he said for then we might have reached him in time to save poor lucy
however the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards as you say
we shall not think of that but go on our way to the end
then he fell into a silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway
before we went to prepare for dinner he said to mr
harker i am told madam mina by my friend john that you and your husband have put up in exact order all things that have been up to this moment
not up to this moment professor she said impulsively but up to this morning
but why not up to now
we have seen hitherto how good light all the little things have made
we have told our secrets and yet no one who has told is the worse for it
harker began to blush and taking a paper from her pockets she said dr van helsing will you read this and tell me if it must go in
it is my record of today
i too have seen the need of putting down at present everything however trivial but there is little in this except what is personal
must it go in
the professor read it over gravely and handed it back saying it need not go in if you do not wish it but i pray that it may
it can but make your husband love you the more and all us your friends more honour youas well as more esteem and love
she took it back with another blush and a bright smile
and so now up to this very hour all the records we have are complete and in order
the professor took away one copy to study after dinner and before our meeting which is fixed for nine oclock
the rest of us have already read everything so when we meet in the study we shall all be informed as to facts and can arrange our plan of battle with this terrible and mysterious enemy
when we met in dr sewards study two hours after dinner which had been at six oclock we unconsciously formed a sort of board or committee
professor van helsing took the head of the table to which dr seward motioned him as he came into the room
he made me sit next to him on his right and asked me to act as secretary jonathan sat next to me
opposite us were lord godalming dr seward and mr morrislord godalming being next the professor and dr seward in the centre
the professor said i may i suppose take it that we are all acquainted with the facts that are in these papers
we all expressed assent and he went on then it were i think good that i tell you something of the kind of enemy with which we have to deal
i shall then make known to you something of the history of this man which has been ascertained for me
so we then can discuss how we shall act and can take our measure according
there are such beings as vampires some of us have evidence that they exist
even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples
i admit that at the first i was sceptic
were it not that through long years i have train myself to keep an open mind i could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear
see
i prove i prove
had i known at the first what now i knownay had i even guess at himone so precious life had been spared to many of us who did love her
but that is gone and we must so work that other poor souls perish not whilst we can save
the nosferatu do not die like the bee when he sting once
he is only stronger and being stronger have yet more power to work evil
this vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men he is of cunning more than mortal for his cunning be the growth of ages he have still the aids of necromancy which is as his etymology imply the divination by the dead and all the dead that he can come nigh to are for him at command he is brute and more than brute he is devil in callous and the heart of him is not he can within limitations appear at will when and where and in any of the forms that are to him he can within his range direct the elements the storm the fog the thunder he can command all the meaner things the rat and the owl and the batthe moth and the fox and the wolf he can grow and become small and he can at times vanish and come unknown
how then are we to begin our strike to destroy him
how shall we find his where and having found it how can we destroy
my friends this is much it is a terrible task that we undertake and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder
for if we fail in this our fight he must surely win and then where end we
life is nothings i heed him not
but to fail here is not mere life or death
it is that we become as him that we henceforward become foul things of the night like himwithout heart or conscience preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best
to us for ever are the gates of heaven shut for who shall open them to us again
we go on for all time abhorred by all a blot on the face of gods sunshine an arrow in the side of him who died for man
but we are face to face with duty and in such case must we shrink
for me i say no but then i am old and life with his sunshine his fair places his song of birds his music and his love lie far behind
you others are young
some have seen sorrow but there are fair days yet in store
what say you
whilst he was speaking jonathan had taken my hand
i feared oh so much that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when i saw his hand stretch out but it was life to me to feel its touchso strong so selfreliant so resolute
a brave mans hand can speak for itself it does not even need a womans love to hear its music
when the professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes and i in his there was no need for speaking between us
i answer for mina and myself he said
count me in professor said mr quincey morris laconically as usual
i am with you said lord godalming for lucys sake if for no other reason
dr seward simply nodded
the professor stood up and after laying his golden crucifix on the table held out his hand on either side
i took his right hand and lord godalming his left jonathan held my right with his left and stretched across to mr morris
so as we all took hands our solemn compact was made
i felt my heart icy cold but it did not even occur to me to draw back
we resumed our places and dr van helsing went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had begun
it was to be taken as gravely and in as businesslike a way as any other transaction of life well you know what we have to contend against but we too are not without strength
we have on our side power of combinationa power denied to the vampire kind we have sources of science we are free to act and think and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally
in fact so far as our powers extend they are unfettered and we are free to use them
we have selfdevotion in a cause and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one
these things are much
now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are restrict and how the individual cannot
in fine let us consider the limitations of the vampire in general and of this one in particular
all we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions
these do not at the first appear much when the matter is one of life and deathnay of more than either life or death
yet must we be satisfied in the first place because we have to beno other means is at our controland secondly because after all these thingstradition and superstitionare everything
does not the belief in vampires rest for othersthough not alas
for uson them
a year ago which of us would have received such a possibility in the midst of our scientific sceptical matteroffact nineteenth century
we even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes
take it then that the vampire and the belief in his limitations and his cure rest for the moment on the same base
for let me tell you he is known everywhere that men have been
in old greece in old rome he flourish in germany all over in france in india even in the chernosese and in china so far from us in all ways there even is he and the peoples fear him at this day
he have follow the wake of the berserker icelander the devilbegotten hun the slav the saxon the magyar
so far then we have all we may act upon and let me tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience
the vampire live on and cannot die by mere passing of the time he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living
even more we have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger that his vital faculties grow strenuous and seem as though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty
but he cannot flourish without this diet he eat not as others
even friend jonathan who lived with him for weeks did never see him to eat never
he throws no shadow he make in the mirror no reflect as again jonathan observe
he has the strength of many of his handwitness again jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs and when he help him from the diligence too
he can transform himself to wolf as we gather from the ship arrival in whitby when he tear open the dog he can be as bat as madam mina saw him on the window at whitby and as friend john saw him fly from this so near house and as my friend quincey saw him at the window of miss lucy
he can come in mist which he createthat noble ships captain proved him of this but from what we know the distance he can make this mist is limited and it can only be round himself
he come on moonlight rays as elemental dustas again jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of dracula
he become so smallwe ourselves saw miss lucy ere she was at peace slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door
he can when once he find his way come out from anything or into anything no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with firesolder you call it
he can see in the darkno small power this in a world which is one half shut from the light
ah but hear me through
he can do all these things yet he is not free
nay he is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley than the madman in his cell
he cannot go where he lists he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of natures lawswhy we know not
he may not enter anywhere at the first unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come though afterwards he can come as he please
his power ceases as does that of all evil things at the coming of the day
only at certain times can he have limited freedom
if he be not at the place whither he is bound he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset
these things are we told and in this record of ours we have proof by inference
thus whereas he can do as he will within his limit when he have his earthhome his coffinhome his hellhome the place unhallowed as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at whitby still at other time he can only change when the time come
it is said too that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide
then there are things which so afflict him that he has no power as the garlic that we know of and as for things sacred as this symbol my crucifix that was amongst us even now when we resolve to them he is nothing but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect
there are others too which i shall tell you of lest in our seeking we may need them
the branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from it a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead and as for the stake through him we know already of its peace or the cutoff head that giveth rest
we have seen it with our eyes
thus when we find the habitation of this manthatwas we can confine him to his coffin and destroy him if we obey what we know
but he is clever
i have asked my friend arminius of budapesth university to make his record and from all the means that are he tell me of what he has been
he must indeed have been that voivode dracula who won his name against the turk over the great river on the very frontier of turkeyland
if it be so then was he no common man for in that time and for centuries after he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning as well as the bravest of the sons of the land beyond the forest
that mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his grave and are even now arrayed against us
the draculas were says arminius a great and noble race though now and again were scions who were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the evil one
they learned his secrets in the scholomance amongst the mountains over lake hermanstadt where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due
in the records are such words as stregoicawitch ordog and pokolsatan and hell and in one manuscript this very dracula is spoken of as wampyr which we all understand too well
there have been from the loins of this very one great men and good women and their graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell
for it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all good in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest
whilst they were talking mr morris was looking steadily at the window and he now got up quietly and went out of the room
there was a little pause and then the professor went on and now we must settle what we do
we have here much data and we must proceed to lay out our campaign
we know from the inquiry of jonathan that from the castle to whitby came fifty boxes of earth all of which were delivered at carfax we also know that at least some of these boxes have been removed
it seems to me that our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall where we look today or whether any more have been removed
if the latter we must trace here we were interrupted in a very startling way
outside the house came the sound of a pistolshot the glass of the window was shattered with a bullet which ricochetting from the top of the embrasure struck the far wall of the room
i am afraid i am at heart a coward for i shrieked out
the men all jumped to their feet lord godalming flew over to the window and threw up the sash
as he did so we heard mr morriss voice without sorry
i fear i have alarmed you
i shall come in and tell you about it
a minute later he came in and said it was an idiotic thing of me to do and i ask your pardon mr
harker most sincerely i fear i must have frightened you terribly
but the fact is that whilst the professor was talking there came a big bat and sat on the windowsill
i have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent events that i cannot stand them and i went out to have a shot as i have been doing of late of evenings whenever i have seen one
you used to laugh at me for it then art
did you hit it
asked dr van helsing
i dont know i fancy not for it flew away into the wood
without saying any more he took his seat and the professor began to resume his statement we must trace each of these boxes and when we are ready we must either capture or kill this monster in his lair or we must so to speak sterilise the earth so that no more he can seek safety in it
thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of noon and sunset and so engage with him when he is at his most weak
and now for you madam mina this night is the end until all be well
you are too precious to us to have such risk
when we part tonight you no more must question
we shall tell you all in good time
we are men and are able to bear but you must be our star and our hope and we shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger such as we are
all the men even jonathan seemed relieved but it did not seem to me good that they should brave danger and perhaps lessen their safetystrength being the best safetythrough care of me but their minds were made up and though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow i could say nothing save to accept their chivalrous care of me
mr morris resumed the discussion as there is no time to lose i vote we have a look at his house right now
time is everything with him and swift action on our part may save another victim
i own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so close but i did not say anything for i had a greater fear that if i appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work they might even leave me out of their counsels altogether
they have now gone off to carfax with means to get into the house
manlike they had told me to go to bed and sleep as if a woman can sleep when those she loves are in danger
i shall lie down and pretend to sleep lest jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns
1 october 4 am just as we were about to leave the house an urgent message was brought to me from renfield to know if i would see him at once as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me
i told the messenger to say that i would attend to his wishes in the morning i was busy just at the moment
the attendant added he seems very importunate sir
i have never seen him so eager
i dont know but what if you dont see him soon he will have one of his violent fits
i knew the man would not have said this without some cause so i said all right ill go now and i asked the others to wait a few minutes for me as i had to go and see my patient
take me with you friend john said the professor
his case in your diary interest me much and it had bearing too now and again on our case
i should much like to see him and especial when his mind is disturbed
may i come also
asked lord godalming
me too
said quincey morris
may i come
said harker
i nodded and we all went down the passage together
we found him in a state of considerable excitement but far more rational in his speech and manner than i had ever seen him
there was an unusual understanding of himself which was unlike anything i had ever met with in a lunatic and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail with others entirely sane
we all four went into the room but none of the others at first said anything
his request was that i would at once release him from the asylum and send him home
this he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery and adduced his own existing sanity
i appeal to your friends he said they will perhaps not mind sitting in judgment on my case
by the way you have not introduced me
i was so much astonished that the oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment and besides there was a certain dignity in the mans manner so much of the habit of equality that i at once made the introduction lord godalming professor van helsing mr quincey morris of texas mr renfield
he shook hands with each of them saying in turn lord godalming i had the honour of seconding your father at the windham i grieve to know by your holding the title that he is no more
he was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him and in his youth was i have heard the inventor of a burnt rum punch much patronised on derby night
mr morris you should be proud of your great state
its reception into the union was a precedent which may have farreaching effects hereafter when the pole and the tropics may hold alliance to the stars and stripes
the power of treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement when the monroe doctrine takes its true place as a political fable
what shall any man say of his pleasure at meeting van helsing
sir i make no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix
when an individual has revolutionised therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brainmatter conventional forms are unfitting since they would seem to limit him to one of a class
you gentlemen who by nationality by heredity or by the possession of natural gifts are fitted to hold your respective places in the moving world i take to witness that i am as sane as at least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties
and i am sure that you dr seward humanitarian and medicojurist as well as scientist will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances
he made this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own charm
i think we were all staggered
for my own part i was under the conviction despite my knowledge of the mans character and history that his reason had been restored and i felt under a strong impulse to tell him that i was satisfied as to his sanity and would see about the necessary formalities for his release in the morning
i thought it better to wait however before making so grave a statement for of old i knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable
so i contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared to be improving very rapidly that i would have a longer chat with him in the morning and would then see what i could do in the direction of meeting his wishes
this did not at all satisfy him for he said quickly but i fear dr seward that you hardly apprehend my wish
i desire to go at onceherenowthis very hourthis very moment if i may
time presses and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of the essence of the contract
i am sure it is only necessary to put before so admirable a practitioner as dr seward so simple yet so momentous a wish to ensure its fulfilment
he looked at me keenly and seeing the negative in my face turned to the others and scrutinised them closely
not meeting any sufficient response he went on is it possible that i have erred in my supposition
you have i said frankly but at the same time as i felt brutally
there was a considerable pause and then he said slowly then i suppose i must only shift my ground of request
let me ask for this concessionboon privilege what you will
i am content to implore in such a case not on personal grounds but for the sake of others
i am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons but you may i assure you take it from me that they are good ones sound and unselfish and spring from the highest sense of duty
could you look sir into my heart you would approve to the full the sentiments which animate me
nay more you would count me amongst the best and truest of your friends
again he looked at us all keenly
i had a growing conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was but yet another form or phase of his madness and so determined to let him go on a little longer knowing from experience that he would like all lunatics give himself away in the end
van helsing was gazing at him with a look of utmost intensity his bushy eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his look
he said to renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time but only when i thought of it afterwardsfor it was as of one addressing an equal can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free tonight
i will undertake that if you will satisfy even mea stranger without prejudice and with the habit of keeping an open minddr seward will give you at his own risk and on his own responsibility the privilege you seek
he shook his head sadly and with a look of poignant regret on his face
the professor went on come sir bethink yourself
you claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree since you seek to impress us with your complete reasonableness
you do this whose sanity we have reason to doubt since you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect
if you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us
be wise and help us and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish
he still shook his head as he said dr van helsing i have nothing to say
your argument is complete and if i were free to speak i should not hesitate a moment but i am not my own master in the matter
i can only ask you to trust me
if i am refused the responsibility does not rest with me
i thought it was now time to end the scene which was becoming too comically grave so i went towards the door simply saying come my friends we have work to do
as however i got near the door a new change came over the patient
he moved towards me so quickly that for the moment i feared that he was about to make another homicidal attack
my fears however were groundless for he held up his two hands imploringly and made his petition in a moving manner
as he saw that the very excess of his emotion was militating against him by restoring us more to our old relations he became still more demonstrative
i glanced at van helsing and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes so i became a little more fixed in my manner if not more stern and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing
i had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of which at the time he had thought much such for instance as when he wanted a cat and i was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion
my expectation was not realised for when he found that his appeal would not be successful he got into quite a frantic condition
he threw himself on his knees and held up his hands wringing them in plaintive supplication and poured forth a torrent of entreaty with the tears rolling down his cheeks and his whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion let me entreat you dr seward oh let me implore you to let me out of this house at once
send me away how you will and where you will send keepers with me with whips and chains let them take me in a straitwaistcoat manacled and legironed even to a gaol but let me go out of this
you dont know what you do by keeping me here
i am speaking from the depths of my heartof my very soul
you dont know whom you wrong or how and i may not tell
woe is me
i may not tell
by all you hold sacredby all you hold dearby your love that is lostby your hope that livesfor the sake of the almighty take me out of this and save my soul from guilt
cant you hear me man
cant you understand
will you never learn
dont you know that i am sane and earnest now that i am no lunatic in a mad fit but a sane man fighting for his soul
oh hear me
hear me
let me go
i thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get and so would bring on a fit so i took him by the hand and raised him up
come i said sternly no more of this we have had quite enough already
get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly
he suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments
then without a word he rose and moving over sat down on the side of the bed
the collapse had come as on former occasion just as i had expected
when i was leaving the room last of our party he said to me in a quiet wellbred voice you will i trust dr seward do me the justice to bear in mind later on that i did what i could to convince you tonight
i am so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work
somehow it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at all but now that her work is done and that it is due to her energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way that every point tells she may well feel that her part is finished and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us
we were i think all a little upset by the scene with mr renfield
when we came away from his room we were silent till we got back to the study
then mr morris said to dr seward say jack if that man wasnt attempting a bluff he is about the sanest lunatic i ever saw
im not sure but i believe that he had some serious purpose and if he had it was pretty rough on him not to get a chance
lord godalming and i were silent but dr van helsing added friend john you know more of lunatics than i do and im glad of it for i fear that if it had been to me to decide i would before that last hysterical outburst have given him free
but we live and learn and in our present task we must take no chance as my friend quincey would say
all is best as they are
dr seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of way i dont know but that i agree with you
if that man had been an ordinary lunatic i would have taken my chance of trusting him but he seems so mixed up with the count in an indexy kind of way that i am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads
i cant forget how he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat and then tried to tear my throat out with his teeth
besides he called the count lord and master and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way
that horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him so i suppose he isnt above trying to use a respectable lunatic
he certainly did seem earnest though
i only hope we have done what is best
these things in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand help to unnerve a man
the professor stepped over and laying his hand on his shoulder said in his grave kindly way friend john have no fear
we are trying to do our duty in a very sad and terrible case we can only do as we deem best
what else have we to hope for except the pity of the good god
lord godalming had slipped away for a few minutes but now he returned
he held up a little silver whistle as he remarked that old place may be full of rats and if so ive got an antidote on call
having passed the wall we took our way to the house taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone out
when we got to the porch the professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things which he laid on the step sorting them into four little groups evidently one for each
then he spoke my friends we are going into a terrible danger and we need arms of many kinds
our enemy is not merely spiritual
remember that he has the strength of twenty men and that though our necks or our windpipes are of the common kindand therefore breakable or crushablehis are not amenable to mere strength
a stronger man or a body of men more strong in all than him can at certain times hold him but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him
we must therefore guard ourselves from his touch
keep this near your heartas he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to me i being nearest to himput these flowers round your neckhere he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossomsfor other enemies more mundane this revolver and this knife and for aid in all these so small electric lamps which you can fasten to your breast and for all and above all at the last this which we must not desecrate needless
this was a portion of sacred wafer which he put in an envelope and handed to me
each of the others was similarly equipped
now he said friend john where are the skeleton keys
if so that we can open the door we need not break house by the window as before at miss lucys
dr seward tried one or two skeleton keys his mechanical dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good stead
presently he got one to suit after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded and with a rusty clang shot back
we pressed on the door the rusty hinges creaked and it slowly opened
it was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in dr sewards diary of the opening of miss westenras tomb i fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others for with one accord they shrank back
the professor was the first to move forward and stepped into the open door
in manus tuas domine
he said crossing himself as he passed over the threshold
we closed the door behind us lest when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road
the professor carefully tried the lock lest we might not be able to open it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit
then we all lit our lamps and proceeded on our search
the light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms as the rays crossed each other or the opacity of our bodies threw great shadows
i could not for my life get away from the feeling that there was some one else amongst us
i suppose it was the recollection so powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings of that terrible experience in transylvania
i think the feeling was common to us all for i noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow just as i felt myself doing
the whole place was thick with dust
the floor was seemingly inches deep except where there were recent footsteps in which on holding down my lamp i could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked
the walls were fluffy and heavy with dust and in the corners were masses of spiders webs whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down
on a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys with a timeyellowed label on each
they had been used several times for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust similar to that exposed when the professor lifted them
he turned to me and said you know this place jonathan
you have copied maps of it and you know it at least more than we do
which is the way to the chapel
i had an idea of its direction though on my former visit i had not been able to get admission to it so i led the way and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite a low arched oaken door ribbed with iron bands
this is the spot said the professor as he turned his lamp on a small map of the house copied from the file of my original correspondence regarding the purchase
with a little trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door
we were prepared for some unpleasantness for as we were opening the door a faint malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps but none of us ever expected such an odour as we encountered
none of the others had met the count at all at close quarters and when i had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of his existence in his rooms or when he was gloated with fresh blood in a ruined building open to the air but here the place was small and close and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul
there was an earthy smell as of some dry miasma which came through the fouler air
but as to the odour itself how shall i describe it
it was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent acrid smell of blood but it seemed as though corruption had become itself corrupt
it sickens me to think of it
every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified its loathsomeness
under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our enterprise to an end but this was no ordinary case and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical considerations
after the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses
we made an accurate examination of the place the professor saying as we began the first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest
a glance was sufficient to show how many remained for the great earth chests were bulky and there was no mistaking them
there were only twentynine left out of the fifty
once i got a fright for seeing lord godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond i looked too and for an instant my heart stood still
somewhere looking out from the shadow i seemed to see the high lights of the counts evil face the ridge of the nose the red eyes the red lips the awful pallor
it was only for a moment for as lord godalming said i thought i saw a face but it was only the shadows and resumed his inquiry i turned my lamp in the direction and stepped into the passage
there was no sign of any one and as there were no corners no doors no aperture of any kind but only the solid walls of the passage there could be no hidingplace even for him
i took it that fear had helped imagination and said nothing
a few minutes later i saw morris step suddenly back from a corner which he was examining
we all followed his movements with our eyes for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence which twinkled like stars
we all instinctively drew back
the whole place was becoming alive with rats
for a moment or two we stood appalled all save lord godalming who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency
rushing over to the great ironbound oaken door which dr seward had described from the outside and which i had seen myself he turned the key in the lock drew the huge bolts and swung the door open
then taking his little silver whistle from his pocket he blew a low shrill call
it was answered from behind dr sewards house by the yelping of dogs and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house
unconsciously we had all moved towards the door and as we moved i noticed that the dust had been much disturbed the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way
but even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased
they seemed to swarm over the place all at once till the lamplight shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering baleful eyes made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies
the dogs dashed on but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled and then simultaneously lifting their noses began to howl in most lugubrious fashion
the rats were multiplying in thousands and we moved out
lord godalming lifted one of the dogs and carrying him in placed him on the floor
the instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to recover his courage and rushed at his natural enemies
they fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score the other dogs who had by now been lifted in the same manner had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished
with their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes
we all seemed to find our spirits rise
whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open i know not but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution
we closed the outer door and barred and locked it and bringing the dogs with us began our search of the house
we found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions and all untouched save for my own footsteps when i had made my first visit
never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbithunting in a summer wood
the morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front
dr van helsing had taken the key of the halldoor from the bunch and locked the door in orthodox fashion putting the key into his pocket when he had done
so far he said our night has been eminently successful
no harm has come to us such as i feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing
more than all do i rejoice that this our firstand perhaps our most difficult and dangerousstep has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet madam mina or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget
one lesson too we have learned if it be allowable to argue a particulari that the brute beasts which are to the counts command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power for look these rats that would come to his call just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mothers cry though they come to him they run pellmell from the so little dogs of my friend arthur
we have other matters before us other dangers other fears and that monsterhe has not used his power over the brute world for the only or the last time tonight
so be it that he has gone elsewhere
it has given us opportunity to cry check in some ways in this chess game which we play for the stake of human souls
and now let us go home
the dawn is close at hand and we have reason to be content with our first nights work
it may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow if full of peril but we must go on and from no danger shall we shrink
the house was silent when we got back save for some poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant wards and a low moaning sound from renfields room
the poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself after the manner of the insane with needless thoughts of pain
i came tiptoe into our own room and found mina asleep breathing so softly that i had to put my ear down to hear it
she looks paler than usual
i hope the meeting tonight has not upset her
i am truly thankful that she is to be left out of our future work and even of our deliberations
it is too great a strain for a woman to bear
i did not think so at first but i know better now
therefore i am glad that it is settled
there may be things which would frighten her to hear and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she suspected that there was any concealment
henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her till at least such time as we can tell her that all is finished and the earth free from a monster of the nether world
i daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as ours but i must be resolute and tomorrow i shall keep dark over tonights doings and shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened
i rest on the sofa so as not to disturb her
1 october later
i suppose it was natural that we should have all overslept ourselves for the day was a busy one and the night had no rest at all
even mina must have felt its exhaustion for though i slept till the sun was high i was awake before her and had to call two or three times before she awoke
indeed she was so sound asleep that for a few seconds she did not recognize me but looked at me with a sort of blank terror as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream
she complained a little of being tired and i let her rest till later in the day
we now know of twentyone boxes having been removed and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace them all
such will of course immensely simplify our labour and the sooner the matter is attended to the better
i shall look up thomas snelling today
1 october
it was towards noon when i was awakened by the professor walking into my room
he was more jolly and cheerful than usual and it is quite evident that last nights work has helped to take some of the brooding weight off his mind
after going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said your patient interests me much
may it be that with you i visit him this morning
or if that you are too occupy i can go alone if it may be
it is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy and reason so sound
i had some work to do which pressed so i told him that if he would go alone i would be glad as then i should not have to keep him waiting so i called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions
before the professor left the room i cautioned him against getting any false impression from my patient
but he answered i want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live things
he said to madam mina as i see in your diary of yesterday that he had once had such a belief
why do you smile friend john
excuse me i said but the answer is here
i laid my hand on the typewritten matter
when our sane and learned lunatic made that very statement of how he used to consume life his mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before mr
harker entered the room
van helsing smiled in turn
your memory is true friend john
i should have remembered
and yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study
perhaps i may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than i shall from the teaching of the most wise
who knows
i went on with my work and before long was through that in hand
it seemed that the time had been very short indeed but there was van helsing back in the study
do i interrupt
he asked politely as he stood at the door
not at all i answered
come in
my work is finished and i am free
i can go with you now if you like
it is needless i have seen him
i fear that he does not appraise me at much
our interview was short
when i entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre with his elbows on his knees and his face was the picture of sullen discontent
i spoke to him as cheerfully as i could and with such a measure of respect as i could assume
he made no reply whatever
dont you know me
his answer was not reassuring i know you well enough you are the old fool van helsing
i wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else
damn all thickheaded dutchmen
not a word more would he say but sat in his implacable sullenness as indifferent to me as though i had not been in the room at all
thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic so i shall go if i may and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul madam mina
friend john it does rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained no more to be worried with our terrible things
though we shall much miss her help it is better so
i agree with you with all my heart i answered earnestly for i did not want him to weaken in this matter
harker is better out of it
things are quite bad enough for us all men of the world and who have been in many tight places in our time but it is no place for a woman and if she had remained in touch with the affair it would in time infallibly have wrecked her
so van helsing has gone to confer with mr
harker and harker quincey and art are all out following up the clues as to the earthboxes
i shall finish my round of work and we shall meet tonight
it is strange to me to be kept in the dark as i am today after jonathans full confidence for so many years to see him manifestly avoid certain matters and those the most vital of all
this morning i slept late after the fatigues of yesterday and though jonathan was late too he was the earlier
he spoke to me before he went out never more sweetly or tenderly but he never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the counts house
and yet he must have known how terribly anxious i was
poor dear fellow
i suppose it must have distressed him even more than it did me
they all agreed that it was best that i should not be drawn further into this awful work and i acquiesced
but to think that he keeps anything from me
and now i am crying like a silly fool when i know it comes from my husbands great love and from the good good wishes of those other strong men
that has done me good
well some day jonathan will tell me all and lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that i kept anything from him i still keep my journal as usual
then if he has feared of my trust i shall show it to him with every thought of my heart put down for his dear eyes to read
i feel strangely sad and lowspirited today
i suppose it is the reaction from the terrible excitement
last night i went to bed when the men had gone simply because they told me to
i didnt feel sleepy and i did feel full of devouring anxiety
i kept thinking over everything that has been ever since jonathan came to see me in london and it all seems like a horrible tragedy with fate pressing on relentlessly to some destined end
everything that one does seems no matter how right it may be to bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored
if i hadnt gone to whitby perhaps poor dear lucy would be with us now
she hadnt taken to visiting the churchyard till i came and if she hadnt come there in the daytime with me she wouldnt have walked there in her sleep and if she hadnt gone there at night and asleep that monster couldnt have destroyed her as he did
oh why did i ever go to whitby
there now crying again
i wonder what has come over me today
i must hide it from jonathan for if he knew that i had been crying twice in one morningi who never cried on my own account and whom he has never caused to shed a tearthe dear fellow would fret his heart out
i shall put a bold face on and if i do feel weepy he shall never see it
i suppose it is one of the lessons that we poor women have to learn
i cant quite remember how i fell asleep last night
i remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds like praying on a very tumultuous scale from mr renfields room which is somewhere under this
and then there was silence over everything silence so profound that it startled me and i got up and looked out of the window
all was dark and silent the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own
not a thing seemed to be stirring but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate so that a thin streak of white mist that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own
i think that the digression of my thoughts must have done me good for when i got back to bed i found a lethargy creeping over me
i lay a while but could not quite sleep so i got out and looked out of the window again
the mist was spreading and was now close up to the house so that i could see it lying thick against the wall as though it were stealing up to the windows
the poor man was more loud than ever and though i could not distinguish a word he said i could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on his part
then there was the sound of a struggle and i knew that the attendants were dealing with him
i was so frightened that i crept into bed and pulled the clothes over my head putting my fingers in my ears
i was not then a bit sleepy at least so i thought but i must have fallen asleep for except dreams i do not remember anything until the morning when jonathan woke me
i think that it took me an effort and a little time to realise where i was and that it was jonathan who was bending over me
my dream was very peculiar and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in or continued in dreams
i thought that i was asleep and waiting for jonathan to come back
i was very anxious about him and i was powerless to act my feet and my hands and my brain were weighted so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace
and so i slept uneasily and thought
then it began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy and dank and cold
i put back the clothes from my face and found to my surprise that all was dim around
the gaslight which i had left lit for jonathan but turned down came only like a tiny red spark through the fog which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room
then it occurred to me that i had shut the window before i had come to bed
i would have got out to make certain on the point but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will
i lay still and endured that was all
i closed my eyes but could still see through my eyelids
it is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us and how conveniently we can imagine
the mist grew thicker and thicker and i could see now how it came in for i could see it like smokeor with the white energy of boiling waterpouring in not through the window but through the joinings of the door
it got thicker and thicker till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room through the top of which i could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye
things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room and through it all came the scriptural words a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night
was it indeed some such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep
but the pillar was composed of both the day and the nightguiding for the fire was in the red eye which at the thought got a new fascination for me till as i looked the fire divided and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes such as lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when on the cliff the dying sunlight struck the windows of st
marys church
suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the moonlight and in my dream i must have fainted for all became black darkness
the last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist
i must be careful of such dreams for they would unseat ones reason if there were too much of them
i would get dr van helsing or dr seward to prescribe something for me which would make me sleep only that i fear to alarm them
such a dream at the present time would become woven into their fears for me
tonight i shall strive hard to sleep naturally
if i do not i shall tomorrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral that cannot hurt me for once and it will give me a good nights sleep
last night tired me more than if i had not slept at all
2 october 10 pm last night i slept but did not dream
i must have slept soundly for i was not waked by jonathan coming to bed but the sleep has not refreshed me for today i feel terribly weak and spiritless
i spent all yesterday trying to read or lying down dozing
in the afternoon mr renfield asked if he might see me
poor man he was very gentle and when i came away he kissed my hand and bade god bless me
some way it affected me much i am crying when i think of him
this is a new weakness of which i must be careful
jonathan would be miserable if he knew i had been crying
he and the others were out till dinnertime and they all came in tired
i did what i could to brighten them up and i suppose that the effort did me good for i forgot how tired i was
after dinner they sent me to bed and all went off to smoke together as they said but i knew that they wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day i could see from jonathans manner that he had something important to communicate
i was not so sleepy as i should have been so before they went i asked dr seward to give me a little opiate of some kind as i had not slept well the night before
he very kindly made me up a sleeping draught which he gave to me telling me that it would do me no harm as it was very mild
i have taken it and am waiting for sleep which still keeps aloof
i hope i have not done wrong for as sleep begins to flirt with me a new fear comes that i may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking
i might want it
here comes sleep
i found thomas snelling in his house at bethnal green but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything
the very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had proved too much and he had begun too early on his expected debauch
i learned however from his wife who seemed a decent poor soul that he was only the assistant to smollet who of the two mates was the responsible person
so off i drove to walworth and found mr joseph smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves taking a late tea out of a saucer
he is a decent intelligent fellow distinctly a good reliable type of workman and with a headpiece of his own
he remembered all about the incident of the boxes and from a wonderful dogseared notebook which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trousers and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick halfobliterated pencil he gave me the destinations of the boxes
there were he said six in the cartload which he took from carfax and left at 197 chicksand street mile end new town and another six which he deposited at jamaica lane bermondsey
if then the count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of his over london these places were chosen as the first of delivery so that later he might distribute more fully
the systematic manner in which this was done made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of london
he was now fixed on the far east of the northern shore on the east of the southern shore and on the south
the north and west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical schemelet alone the city itself and the very heart of fashionable london in the southwest and west
i went back to smollet and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from carfax
he replied well guvnor youve treated me wery ansomei had given him half a sovereignan ill tell yer all i know
i heard a man by the name of bloxam say four nights ago in the are an ounds in pinchers alley as ow he an his mate ad ad a rare dusty job in a old ouse at purfect
there aint amany such jobs as this ere an im thinkin that maybe sam bloxam could tell ye summut
i asked if he could tell me where to find him
i told him that if he could get me the address it would be worth another halfsovereign to him
so he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up saying that he was going to begin the search then and there
at the door he stopped and said look ere guvnor there aint no sense in me akeepin you ere
i may find sam soon or i maynt but anyhow he aint like to be in a way to tell ye much tonight
sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze
if you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it and put yer address on it ill find out where sam is to be found and post it ye tonight
but yed better be up arter im soon in the mornin or maybe ye wont ketch im for sam gets off main early never mind the booze the night afore
this was all practical so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper and to keep the change
when she came back i addressed the envelope and stamped it and when smollet had again faithfully promised to post the address when found i took my way to home
were on the track anyhow
i am tired tonight and want sleep
mina is fast asleep and looks a little too pale her eyes look as though she had been crying
poor dear ive no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the others
but it is best as it is
it is better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken
the doctors were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful business
i must be firm for on me this particular burden of silence must rest
i shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any circumstances
indeed it may not be a hard task after all for she herself has become reticent on the subject and has not spoken of the count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision
2 october evening
a long and trying and exciting day
by the first post i got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed on which was written with a carpenters pencil in a sprawling hand sam bloxam korkrans 4 poters cort bartel street walworth
arsk for the depite
i got the letter in bed and rose without waking mina
she looked heavy and sleepy and pale and far from well
i determined not to wake her but that when i should return from this new search i would arrange for her going back to exeter
i think she would be happier in our own home with her daily tasks to interest her than in being here amongst us and in ignorance
i only saw dr seward for a moment and told him where i was off to promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as i should have found out anything
i drove to walworth and found with some difficulty potters court
mr smollets spelling misled me as i asked for poters court instead of potters court
however when i had found the court i had no difficulty in discovering corcorans lodginghouse
when i asked the man who came to the door for the depite he shook his head and said i dunno im
there aint no such a person ere i never eard of im in all my bloomin days
dont believe there aint nobody of that kind livin ere or anywheres
i took out smollets letter and as i read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me
what are you
im the depity he answered
i saw at once that i was on the right track phonetic spelling had again misled me
a halfcrown tip put the deputys knowledge at my disposal and i learned that mr bloxam who had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at corcorans had left for his work at poplar at five oclock that morning
he could not tell me where the place of work was situated but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a newfangled wareus and with this slender clue i had to start for poplar
it was twelve oclock before i got any satisfactory hint of such a building and this i got at a coffeeshop where some workmen were having their dinner
one of these suggested that there was being erected at cross angel street a new cold storage building and as this suited the condition of a newfangled wareus i at once drove to it
an interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm put me on the track of bloxam he was sent for on my suggesting that i was willing to pay his days wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter
he was a smart enough fellow though rough of speech and bearing
when i had promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest he told me that he had made two journeys between carfax and a house in piccadilly and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxesmain heavy oneswith a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose
i asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in piccadilly to which he replied well guvnor i forgits the number but it was only a few doors from a big white church or somethink of the kind not long built
it was a dusty old ouse too though nothin to the dustiness of the ouse we tooked the bloomin boxes from
how did you get into the houses if they were both empty
there was the old party what engaged me awaitin in the ouse at purfleet
he elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray
curse me but he was the strongest chap i ever struck an him a old feller with a white moustache one that thin you would think he couldnt throw a shadder
how this phrase thrilled through me
why e took up is end o the boxes like they was pounds of tea and me apuffin an ablowin afore i could upend mine anyhowan im no chicken neither
how did you get into the house in piccadilly
he was there too
he must a started off and got there afore me for when i rung of the bell he kem an opened the door isself an elped me to carry the boxes into the all
the whole nine
yus there was five in the first load an four in the second
it was main dry work an i dont so well remember ow i got ome
i interrupted him were the boxes left in the hall
yus it was a big all an there was nothin else in it
i made one more attempt to further matters you didnt have any key
never used no key nor nothink
the old gent he opened the door isself an shut it again when i druv off
i dont remember the last timebut that was the beer
and you cant remember the number of the house
no sir
but ye neednt have no difficulty about that
its a igh un with a stone front with a bow on it an igh steps up to the door
i know them steps avin ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers what come round to earn a copper
the old gent give them shillins an they seein they got so much they wanted more but e took one of them by the shoulder and was like to throw im down the steps till the lot of them went away cussin
i thought that with this description i could find the house so having paid my friend for his information i started off for piccadilly
i had gained a new painful experience the count could it was evident handle the earthboxes himself
if so time was precious for now that he had achieved a certain amount of distribution he could by choosing his own time complete the task unobserved
at piccadilly circus i discharged my cab and walked westward beyond the junior constitutional i came across the house described and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by dracula
the house looked as though it had been long untenanted
the windows were encrusted with dust and the shutters were up
all the framework was black with time and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away
it was evident that up to lately there had been a large noticeboard in front of the balcony it had however been roughly torn away the uprights which had supported it still remaining
behind the rails of the balcony i saw there were some loose boards whose raw edges looked white
i would have given a good deal to have been able to see the noticeboard intact as it would perhaps have given some clue to the ownership of the house
i remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of carfax and i could not but feel that if i could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house
there was at present nothing to be learned from the piccadilly side and nothing could be done so i went round to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter
the mews were active the piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation
i asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom i saw around if they could tell me anything about the empty house
one of them said that he heard it had lately been taken but he couldnt say from whom
he told me however that up to very lately there had been a noticeboard of for sale up and that perhaps mitchell sons & candy the house agents could tell me something as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board
i did not wish to seem too eager or to let my informant know or guess too much so thanking him in the usual manner i strolled away
it was now growing dusk and the autumn night was closing in so i did not lose any time
having learned the address of mitchell sons & candy from a directory at the berkeley i was soon at their office in sackville street
the gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner but uncommunicative in equal proportion
having once told me that the piccadilly housewhich throughout our interview he called a mansionwas sold he considered my business as concluded
when i asked who had purchased it he opened his eyes a thought wider and paused a few seconds before replying it is sold sir
pardon me i said with equal politeness but i have a special reason for wishing to know who purchased it
again he paused longer and raised his eyebrows still more
it is sold sir was again his laconic reply
surely i said you do not mind letting me know so much
but i do mind he answered
the affairs of their clients are absolutely safe in the hands of mitchell sons & candy
this was manifestly a prig of the first water and there was no use arguing with him
i thought i had best meet him on his own ground so i said your clients sir are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their confidence
i am myself a professional man
here i handed him my card
in this instance i am not prompted by curiosity i act on the part of lord godalming who wishes to know something of the property which was he understood lately for sale
these words put a different complexion on affairs
he said i would like to oblige you if i could mr harker and especially would i like to oblige his lordship
we once carried out a small matter of renting some chambers for him when he was the honourable arthur holmwood
if you will let me have his lordships address i will consult the house on the subject and will in any case communicate with his lordship by tonights post
it will be a pleasure if we can so far deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his lordship
i wanted to secure a friend and not to make an enemy so i thanked him gave the address at dr sewards and came away
it was now dark and i was tired and hungry
i got a cup of tea at the arated bread company and came down to purfleet by the next train
i found all the others at home
mina was looking tired and pale but she made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful it wrung my heart to think that i had had to keep anything from her and so caused her inquietude
thank god this will be the last night of her looking on at our conferences and feeling the sting of our not showing our confidence
it took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of keeping her out of our grim task
she seems somehow more reconciled or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her for when any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders
i am glad we made our resolution in time as with such a feeling as this our growing knowledge would be torture to her
i could not tell the others of the days discovery till we were alone so after dinnerfollowed by a little music to save appearances even amongst ourselvesi took mina to her room and left her to go to bed
the dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever and clung to me as though she would detain me but there was much to be talked of and i came away
thank god the ceasing of telling things has made no difference between us
when i came down again i found the others all gathered round the fire in the study
in the train i had written my diary so far and simply read it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own information when i had finished van helsing said this has been a great days work friend jonathan
doubtless we are on the track of the missing boxes
if we find them all in that house then our work is near the end
but if there be some missing we must search until we find them
then shall we make our final coup and hunt the wretch to his real death
we all sat silent awhile and all at once mr morris spoke say
how are we going to get into that house
we got into the other answered lord godalming quickly
but art this is different
we broke house at carfax but we had night and a walled park to protect us
it will be a mighty different thing to commit burglary in piccadilly either by day or night
i confess i dont see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of some sort perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the morning
lord godalmings brows contracted and he stood up and walked about the room
byandby he stopped and said turning from one to another of us quinceys head is level
this burglary business is getting serious we got off once all right but we have now a rare job on handunless we can find the counts key basket
as nothing could well be done before morning and as it would be at least advisable to wait till lord godalming should hear from mitchells we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time
for a good while we sat and smoked discussing the matter in its various lights and bearings i took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the moment
i am very sleepy and shall go to bed
just a line
mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular
her forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles as though she thinks even in her sleep
she is still too pale but does not look so haggard as she did this morning
tomorrow will i hope mend all this she will be herself at home in exeter
oh but i am sleepy
i am puzzled afresh about renfield
his moods change so rapidly that i find it difficult to keep touch of them and as they always mean something more than his own wellbeing they form a more than interesting study
this morning when i went to see him after his repulse of van helsing his manner was that of a man commanding destiny
he was in fact commanding destinysubjectively
he did not really care for any of the things of mere earth he was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals
i thought i would improve the occasion and learn something so i asked him what about the flies these times
he smiled on me in quite a superior sort of waysuch a smile as would have become the face of malvolioas he answered me the fly my dear sir has one striking feature its wings are typical of the arial powers of the psychic faculties
the ancients did well when they typified the soul as a butterfly
i thought i would push his analogy to its utmost logically so i said quickly oh it is a soul you are after now is it
his madness foiled his reason and a puzzled look spread over his face as shaking his head with a decision which i had but seldom seen in him he said oh no oh no
i want no souls
life is all i want
here he brightened up i am pretty indifferent about it at present
life is all right i have all i want
you must get a new patient doctor if you wish to study zophagy
this puzzled me a little so i drew him on then you command life you are a god i suppose
he smiled with an ineffably benign superiority
oh no
far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the deity
i am not even concerned in his especially spiritual doings
if i may state my intellectual position i am so far as concerns things purely terrestrial somewhat in the position which enoch occupied spiritually
this was a poser to me
i could not at the moment recall enochs appositeness so i had to ask a simple question though i felt that by so doing i was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic and why with enoch
because he walked with god
i could not see the analogy but did not like to admit it so i harked back to what he had denied so you dont care about life and you dont want souls
i put my question quickly and somewhat sternly on purpose to disconcert him
the effort succeeded for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his old servile manner bent low before me and actually fawned upon me as he replied i dont want any souls indeed indeed
i dont
i couldnt use them if i had them they would be no manner of use to me
i couldnt eat them or he suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his face like a windsweep on the surface of the water
and doctor as to life what is it after all
when youve got all you require and you know that you will never want that is all
i have friendsgood friendslike you dr seward this was said with a leer of inexpressible cunning
i know that i shall never lack the means of life
i think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some antagonism in me for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as hea dogged silence
after a short time i saw that for the present it was useless to speak to him
he was sulky and so i came away
later in the day he sent for me
ordinarily i would not have come without special reason but just at present i am so interested in him that i would gladly make an effort
besides i am glad to have anything to help to pass the time
harker is out following up clues and so are lord godalming and quincey
van helsing sits in my study poring over the record prepared by the harkers he seems to think that by accurate knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue
he does not wish to be disturbed in the work without cause
i would have taken him with me to see the patient only i thought that after his last repulse he might not care to go again
there was also another reason renfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and i were alone
i found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool a pose which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part
when i came in he said at once as though the question had been waiting on his lips what about souls
it was evident then that my surmise had been correct
unconscious cerebration was doing its work even with the lunatic
i determined to have the matter out
what about them yourself
he did not reply for a moment but looked all round him and up and down as though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer
i dont want any souls
he said in a feeble apologetic way
the matter seemed preying on his mind and so i determined to use itto be cruel only to be kind
so i said you like life and you want life
but that is all right you neednt worry about that
but i asked how are we to get the life without getting the soul also
this seemed to puzzle him so i followed it up a nice time youll have some time when youre flying out there with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing and twittering and miauing all round you
youve got their lives you know and you must put up with their souls
something seemed to affect his imagination for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being soaped
there was something pathetic in it that touched me it also gave me a lesson for it seemed that before me was a childonly a child though the features were worn and the stubble on the jaws was white
it was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance and knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself i thought i would enter into his mind as well as i could and go with him
the first step was to restore confidence so i asked him speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears would you like some sugar to get your flies round again
he seemed to wake up all at once and shook his head
with a laugh he replied not much
flies are poor things after all
after a pause he added but i dont want their souls buzzing round me all the same
or spiders
i went on
blow spiders
whats the use of spiders
there isnt anything in them to eat orhe stopped suddenly as though reminded of a forbidden topic
so so
i thought to myself this is the second time he has suddenly stopped at the word drink what does it mean
renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse for he hurried on as though to distract my attention from it i dont take any stock at all in such matters
rats and mice and such small deer as shakespeare has it chickenfeed of the larder they might be called
im past all that sort of nonsense
you might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks as to try to interest me about the lesser carnivora when i know of what is before me
i see i said
you want big things that you can make your teeth meet in
how would you like to breakfast on elephant
what ridiculous nonsense you are talking
he was getting too wide awake so i thought i would press him hard
i wonder i said reflectively what an elephants soul is like
the effect i desired was obtained for he at once fell from his highhorse and became a child again
i dont want an elephants soul or any soul at all
for a few moments he sat despondently
suddenly he jumped to his feet with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement
to hell with you and your souls
he shouted
why do you plague me about souls
havent i got enough to worry and pain and distract me already without thinking of souls
he looked so hostile that i thought he was in for another homicidal fit so i blew my whistle
the instant however that i did so he became calm and said apologetically forgive me doctor i forgot myself
you do not need any help
i am so worried in my mind that i am apt to be irritable
if you only knew the problem i have to face and that i am working out you would pity and tolerate and pardon me
pray do not put me in a straitwaistcoat
i want to think and i cannot think freely when my body is confined
i am sure you will understand
he had evidently selfcontrol so when the attendants came i told them not to mind and they withdrew
renfield watched them go when the door was closed he said with considerable dignity and sweetness dr seward you have been very considerate towards me
believe me that i am very very grateful to you
i thought it well to leave him in this mood and so i came away
there is certainly something to ponder over in this mans state
several points seem to make what the american interviewer calls a story if one could only get them in proper order
here they are will not mention drinking
fears the thought of being burdened with the soul of anything
has no dread of wanting life in the future
despises the meaner forms of life altogether though he dreads being haunted by their souls
logically all these things point one way
he has assurance of some kind that he will acquire some higher life
he dreads the consequencethe burden of a soul
then it is a human life he looks to
and the assurance
the count has been to him and there is some new scheme of terror afoot
i went after my round to van helsing and told him my suspicion
he grew very grave and after thinking the matter over for a while asked me to take him to renfield
i did so
as we came to the door we heard the lunatic within singing gaily as he used to do in the time which now seems so long ago
when we entered we saw with amazement that he had spread out his sugar as of old the flies lethargic with the autumn were beginning to buzz into the room
we tried to make him talk of the subject of our previous conversation but he would not attend
he went on with his singing just as though we had not been present
he had got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a notebook
we had to come away as ignorant as we went in
his is a curious case indeed we must watch him tonight
letter mitchell sons and candy to lord godalming
my lord we are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes
we beg with regard to the desire of your lordship expressed by mr harker on your behalf to supply the following information concerning the sale and purchase of no
347 piccadilly
the original vendors are the executors of the late mr archibald wintersuffield
the purchaser is a foreign nobleman count de ville who effected the purchase himself paying the purchase money in notes over the counter if your lordship will pardon us using so vulgar an expression
beyond this we know nothing whatever of him
we are my lord your lordships humble servants mitchell sons & candy
2 october
i placed a man in the corridor last night and told him to make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from renfields room and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he was to call me
after dinner when we had all gathered round the fire in the studymr
harker having gone to bedwe discussed the attempts and discoveries of the day
harker was the only one who had any result and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one
before going to bed i went round to the patients room and looked in through the observation trap
he was sleeping soundly and his heart rose and fell with regular respiration
this morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly
i asked him if that was all he replied that it was all he heard
there was something about his manner so suspicious that i asked him point blank if he had been asleep
he denied sleep but admitted to having dozed for a while
it is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are watched
today harker is out following up his clue and art and quincey are looking after horses
godalming thinks that it will be well to have horses always in readiness for when we get the information which we seek there will be no time to lose
we must sterilise all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset we shall thus catch the count at his weakest and without a refuge to fly to
van helsing is off to the british museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine
the old physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept and the professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be useful to us later
i sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in straitwaistcoats
we have met again
we seem at last to be on the track and our work of tomorrow may be the beginning of the end
i wonder if renfields quiet has anything to do with this
his moods have so followed the doings of the count that the coming destruction of the monster may be carried to him in some subtle way
if we could only get some hint as to what passed in his mind between the time of my argument with him today and his resumption of flycatching it might afford us a valuable clue
he is now seemingly quiet for a spell
is he
that wild yell seemed to come from his room
the attendant came bursting into my room and told me that renfield had somehow met with some accident
he had heard him yell and when he went to him found him lying on his face on the floor all covered with blood
i must go at once
let me put down with exactness all that happened as well as i can remember it since last i made an entry
not a detail that i can recall must be forgotten in all calmness i must proceed
when i came to renfields room i found him lying on the floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood
when i went to move him it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity
as the face was exposed i could see that it was horribly bruised as though it had been beaten against the floorindeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated
the attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned him over i think sir his back is broken
see both his right arm and leg and the whole side of his face are paralysed
how such a thing could have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure
he seemed quite bewildered and his brows were gathered in as he said i cant understand the two things
he could mark his face like that by beating his own head on the floor
i saw a young woman do it once at the eversfield asylum before anyone could lay hands on her
and i suppose he might have broke his neck by falling out of bed if he got in an awkward kink
but for the life of me i cant imagine how the two things occurred
if his back was broke he couldnt beat his head and if his face was like that before the fall out of bed there would be marks of it
i said to him go to dr van helsing and ask him to kindly come here at once
i want him without an instants delay
the man ran off and within a few minutes the professor in his dressing gown and slippers appeared
when he saw renfield on the ground he looked keenly at him a moment and then turned to me
i think he recognised my thought in my eyes for he said very quietly manifestly for the ears of the attendant ah a sad accident
he will need very careful watching and much attention
i shall stay with you myself but i shall first dress myself
if you will remain i shall in a few minutes join you
the patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that he had suffered some terrible injury
van helsing returned with extraordinary celerity bearing with him a surgical case
he had evidently been thinking and had his mind made up for almost before he looked at the patient he whispered to me send the attendant away
we must be alone with him when he becomes conscious after the operation
so i said i think that will do now simmons
we have done all that we can at present
you had better go your round and dr van helsing will operate
let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere
the man withdrew and we went into a strict examination of the patient
the wounds of the face was superficial the real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull extending right up through the motor area
the professor thought a moment and said we must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions as far as can be the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of his injury
the whole motor area seems affected
the suffusion of the brain will increase quickly so we must trephine at once or it may be too late
as he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door
i went over and opened it and found in the corridor without arthur and quincey in pajamas and slippers the former spoke i heard your man call up dr van helsing and tell him of an accident
so i woke quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep
things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times
ive been thinking that tomorrow night will not see things as they have been
well have to look backand forward a little more than we have done
may we come in
i nodded and held the door open till they had entered then i closed it again
when quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient and noted the horrible pool on the floor he said softly my god
what has happened to him
poor poor devil
i told him briefly and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after the operationfor a short time at all events
he went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed with godalming beside him we all watched in patience
we shall wait said van helsing just long enough to fix the best spot for trephining so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove the blood clot for it is evident that the hmorrhage is increasing
the minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness
i had a horrible sinking in my heart and from van helsings face i gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come
i dreaded the words that renfield might speak
i was positively afraid to think but the conviction of what was coming was on me as i have read of men who have heard the deathwatch
the poor mans breathing came in uncertain gasps
each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath and he would relapse into a more fixed insensibility
inured as i was to sick beds and death this suspense grew and grew upon me
i could almost hear the beating of my own heart and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer
the silence finally became agonising
i looked at my companions one after another and saw from their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture
there was a nervous suspense over us all as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it
at last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was sinking fast he might die at any moment
i looked up at the professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine
his face was sternly set as he spoke there is no time to lose
his words may be worth many lives i have been thinking so as i stood here
it may be there is a soul at stake
we shall operate just above the ear
without another word he made the operation
for a few moments the breathing continued to be stertorous
then there came a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest
suddenly his eyes opened and became fixed in a wild helpless stare
this was continued for a few moments then it softened into a glad surprise and from the lips came a sigh of relief
he moved convulsively and as he did so said ill be quiet doctor
tell them to take off the straitwaistcoat
i have had a terrible dream and it has left me so weak that i cannot move
whats wrong with my face
it feels all swollen and it smarts dreadfully
he tried to turn his head but even with the effort his eyes seemed to grow glassy again so i gently put it back
then van helsing said in a quiet grave tone tell us your dream mr renfield
as he heard the voice his face brightened through its mutilation and he said that is dr van helsing
how good it is of you to be here
give me some water my lips are dry and i shall try to tell you
i dreamedhe stopped and seemed fainting i called quietly to quinceythe brandyit is in my studyquick
he flew and returned with a glass the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water
we moistened the parched lips and the patient quickly revived
it seemed however that his poor injured brain had been working in the interval for when he was quite conscious he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which i shall never forget and said i must not deceive myself it was no dream but all a grim reality
then his eyes roved round the room as they caught sight of the two figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on if i were not sure already i would know from them
for an instant his eyes closednot with pain or sleep but voluntarily as though he were bringing all his faculties to bear when he opened them he said hurriedly and with more energy than he had yet displayed quick doctor quick
i am dying
i feel that i have but a few minutes and then i must go back to deathor worse
wet my lips with brandy again
i have something that i must say before i die or before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow
thank you
it was that night after you left me when i implored you to let me go away
i couldnt speak then for i felt my tongue was tied but i was as sane then except in that way as i am now
i was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me it seemed hours
then there came a sudden peace to me
my brain seemed to become cool again and i realised where i was
i heard the dogs bark behind our house but not where he was
as he spoke van helsings eyes never blinked but his hand came out and met mine and gripped it hard
he did not however betray himself he nodded slightly and said go on in a low voice
renfield proceeded he came up to the window in the mist as i had seen him often before but he was solid thennot a ghost and his eyes were fierce like a mans when angry
he was laughing with his red mouth the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt of trees to where the dogs were barking
i wouldnt ask him to come in at first though i knew he wanted tojust as he had wanted all along
then he began promising me thingsnot in words but by doing them
he was interrupted by a word from the professor how
by making them happen just as he used to send in the flies when the sun was shining
great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their wings and big moths in the night with skull and crossbones on their backs
van helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously the acherontia aitetropos of the sphinges what you call the deathshead moth
the patient went on without stopping
then he began to whisper rats rats rats
hundreds thousands millions of them and every one a life and dogs to eat them and cats too
all lives
all red blood with years of life in it and not merely buzzing flies
i laughed at him for i wanted to see what he could do
then the dogs howled away beyond the dark trees in his house
he beckoned me to the window
i got up and looked out and he raised his hands and seemed to call out without using any words
a dark mass spread over the grass coming on like the shape of a flame of fire and then he moved the mist to the right and left and i could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing redlike his only smaller
he held up his hand and they all stopped and i thought he seemed to be saying all these lives will i give you ay and many more and greater through countless ages if you will fall down and worship me
and then a red cloud like the colour of blood seemed to close over my eyes and before i knew what i was doing i found myself opening the sash and saying to him come in lord and master
the rats were all gone but he slid into the room through the sash though it was only open an inch widejust as the moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and splendour
his voice was weaker so i moistened his lips with the brandy again and he continued but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in the interval for his story was further advanced
i was about to call him back to the point but van helsing whispered to me let him go on
do not interrupt him he cannot go back and maybe could not proceed at all if once he lost the thread of his thought
he proceeded all day i waited to hear from him but he did not send me anything not even a blowfly and when the moon got up i was pretty angry with him
when he slid in through the window though it was shut and did not even knock i got mad with him
he sneered at me and his white face looked out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming and he went on as though he owned the whole place and i was no one
he didnt even smell the same as he went by me
i couldnt hold him
i thought that somehow mr
harker had come into the room
the two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over standing behind him so that he could not see them but where they could hear better
they were both silent but the professor started and quivered his face however grew grimmer and sterner still
renfield went on without noticing when mr
harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasnt the same it was like tea after the teapot had been watered
here we all moved but no one said a word he went on i didnt know that she was here till she spoke and she didnt look the same
i dont care for the pale people i like them with lots of blood in them and hers had all seemed to have run out
i didnt think of it at the time but when she went away i began to think and it made me mad to know that he had been taking the life out of her
i could feel that the rest quivered as i did but we remained otherwise still
so when he came tonight i was ready for him
i saw the mist stealing in and i grabbed it tight
i had heard that madmen have unnatural strength and as i knew i was a madmanat times anyhowi resolved to use my power
ay and he felt it too for he had to come out of the mist to struggle with me
i held tight and i thought i was going to win for i didnt mean him to take any more of her life till i saw his eyes
they burned into me and my strength became like water
he slipped through it and when i tried to cling to him he raised me up and flung me down
there was a red cloud before me and a noise like thunder and the mist seemed to steal away under the door
his voice was becoming fainter and his breath more stertorous
van helsing stood up instinctively
we know the worst now he said
he is here and we know his purpose
it may not be too late
let us be armedthe same as we were the other night but lose no time there is not an instant to spare
there was no need to put our fear nay our conviction into wordswe shared them in common
we all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we had when we entered the counts house
the professor had his ready and as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said they never leave me and they shall not till this unhappy business is over
be wise also my friends
it is no common enemy that we deal with
that that dear madam mina should suffer
he stopped his voice was breaking and i do not know if rage or terror predominated in my own heart
outside the harkers door we paused
art and quincey held back and the latter said should we disturb her
we must said van helsing grimly
if the door be locked i shall break it in
may it not frighten her terribly
it is unusual to break into a ladys room
van helsing said solemnly you are always right but this is life and death
all chambers are alike to the doctor and even were they not they are all as one to me tonight
friend john when i turn the handle if the door does not open do you put your shoulder down and shove and you too my friends
now
he turned the handle as he spoke but the door did not yield
we threw ourselves against it with a crash it burst open and we almost fell headlong into the room
the professor did actually fall and i saw across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees
what i saw appalled me
i felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck and my heart seemed to stand still
the moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see
on the bed beside the window lay jonathan harker his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor
kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the whiteclad figure of his wife
by her side stood a tall thin man clad in black
his face was turned from us but the instant we saw we all recognised the countin every way even to the scar on his forehead
with his left hand he held both mr
harkers hands keeping them away with her arms at full tension his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck forcing her face down on his bosom
her white nightdress was smeared with blood and a thin stream trickled down the mans bare breast which was shown by his tornopen dress
the attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kittens nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink
as we burst into the room the count turned his face and the hellish look that i had heard described seemed to leap into it
his eyes flamed red with devilish passion the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge and the white sharp teeth behind the full lips of the blooddripping mouth champed together like those of a wild beast
with a wrench which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height he turned and sprang at us
but by this time the professor had gained his feet and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the sacred wafer
the count suddenly stopped just as poor lucy had done outside the tomb and cowered back
further and further back he cowered as we lifting our crucifixes advanced
the moonlight suddenly failed as a great black cloud sailed across the sky and when the gaslight sprang up under quinceys match we saw nothing but a faint vapour
this as we looked trailed under the door which with the recoil from its bursting open had swung back to its old position
van helsing art and i moved forward to mr
harker who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild so earpiercing so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day
for a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray
her face was ghastly with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin from her throat trickled a thin stream of blood her eyes were mad with terror
then she put before her face her poor crushed hands which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the counts terrible grip and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief
van helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body whilst art after looking at her face for an instant despairingly ran out of the room
van helsing whispered to me jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the vampire can produce
we can do nothing with poor madam mina for a few moments till she recovers herself i must wake him
he dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it began to flick him on the face his wife all the while holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was heartbreaking to hear
i raised the blind and looked out of the window
there was much moonshine and as i looked i could see quincey morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yewtree
it puzzled me to think why he was doing this but at the instant i heard harkers quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness and turned to the bed
on his face as there might well be was a look of wild amazement
he seemed dazed for a few seconds and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once and he started up
his wife was aroused by the quick movement and turned to him with her arms stretched out as though to embrace him instantly however she drew them in again and putting her elbows together held her hands before her face and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook
in gods name what does this mean
harker cried out
dr seward dr van helsing what is it
what has happened
what is wrong
mina dear what is it
what does that blood mean
my god my god
has it come to this
and raising himself to his knees he beat his hands wildly together
good god help us
help her
oh help her
with a quick movement he jumped from bed and began to pull on his clothesall the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion
tell me all about it
he cried without pausing
dr van helsing you love mina i know
oh do something to save her
it cannot have gone too far yet
guard her while i look for him
his wife through her terror and horror and distress saw some sure danger to him instantly forgetting her own grief she seized hold of him and cried out no
jonathan you must not leave me
i have suffered enough tonight god knows without the dread of his harming you
you must stay with me
stay with these friends who will watch over you
her expression became frantic as she spoke and he yielding to her she pulled him down sitting on the bed side and clung to him fiercely
van helsing and i tried to calm them both
the professor held up his little golden crucifix and said with wonderful calmness do not fear my dear
we are here and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can approach
you are safe for tonight and we must be calm and take counsel together
she shuddered and was silent holding down her head on her husbands breast
when she raised it his white nightrobe was stained with blood where her lips had touched and where the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops
the instant she saw it she drew back with a low wail and whispered amidst choking sobs unclean unclean
i must touch him or kiss him no more
oh that it should be that it is i who am now his worst enemy and whom he may have most cause to fear
to this he spoke out resolutely nonsense mina
it is a shame to me to hear such a word
i would not hear it of you and i shall not hear it from you
may god judge me by my deserts and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us
he put out his arms and folded her to his breast and for a while she lay there sobbing
he looked at us over her bowed head with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils his mouth was set as steel
after a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint and then he said to me speaking with a studied calmness which i felt tried his nervous power to the utmost and now dr seward tell me all about it
too well i know the broad fact tell me all that has been
i told him exactly what had happened and he listened with seeming impassiveness but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as i told how the ruthless hands of the count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position with her mouth to the open wound in his breast
it interested me even at that moment to see that whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair
just as i had finished quincey and godalming knocked at the door
they entered in obedience to our summons
van helsing looked at me questioningly
i understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from themselves so on nodding acquiescence to him he asked them what they had seen or done
to which lord godalming answered i could not see him anywhere in the passage or in any of our rooms
i looked in the study but though he had been there he had gone
he had however he stopped suddenly looking at the poor drooping figure on the bed
van helsing said gravely go on friend arthur
we want here no more concealments
our hope now is in knowing all
tell freely
so art went on he had been there and though it could only have been for a few seconds he made rare hay of the place
all the manuscript had been burned and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes the cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire and the wax had helped the flames
here i interrupted
thank god there is the other copy in the safe
his face lit for a moment but fell again as he went on i ran downstairs then but could see no sign of him
i looked into renfields room but there was no trace there except
again he paused
go on said harker hoarsely so he bowed his head and moistening his lips with his tongue added except that the poor fellow is dead
harker raised her head looking from one to the other of us she said solemnly gods will be done
i could not but feel that art was keeping back something but as i took it that it was with a purpose i said nothing
van helsing turned to morris and asked and you friend quincey have you any to tell
a little he answered
it may be much eventually but at present i cant say
i thought it well to know if possible where the count would go when he left the house
i did not see him but i saw a bat rise from renfields window and flap westward
i expected to see him in some shape go back to carfax but he evidently sought some other lair
he will not be back tonight for the sky is reddening in the east and the dawn is close
we must work tomorrow
he said the latter words through his shut teeth
for a space of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence and i could fancy that i could hear the sound of our hearts beating then van helsing said placing his hand very tenderly on mr
harkers head and now madam minapoor dear dear madam minatell us exactly what happened
god knows that i do not want that you be pained but it is need that we know all
for now more than ever has all work to be done quick and sharp and in deadly earnest
the day is close to us that must end all if it may be so and now is the chance that we may live and learn
the poor dear lady shivered and i could see the tension of her nerves as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and lower still on his breast
then she raised her head proudly and held out one hand to van helsing who took it in his and after stooping and kissing it reverently held it fast
the other hand was locked in that of her husband who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly
after a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts she began i took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me but for a long time it did not act
i seemed to become more wakeful and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mindall of them connected with death and vampires with blood and pain and trouble
her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly do not fret dear
you must be brave and strong and help me through the horrible task
if you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all you would understand how much i need your help
well i saw i must try to help the medicine to its work with my will if it was to do me any good so i resolutely set myself to sleep
sure enough sleep must soon have come to me for i remember no more
jonathan coming in had not waked me for he lay by my side when next i remember
there was in the room the same thin white mist that i had before noticed
but i forget now if you know of this you will find it in my diary which i shall show you later
i felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence
i turned to wake jonathan but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught and not i
i tried but i could not wake him
this caused me a great fear and i looked around terrified
then indeed my heart sank within me beside the bed as if he had stepped out of the mistor rather as if the mist had turned into his figure for it had entirely disappearedstood a tall thin man all in black
i knew him at once from the description of the others
the waxen face the high aquiline nose on which the light fell in a thin white line the parted red lips with the sharp white teeth showing between and the red eyes that i had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of st
marys church at whitby
i knew too the red scar on his forehead where jonathan had struck him
for an instant my heart stood still and i would have screamed out only that i was paralysed
in the pause he spoke in a sort of keen cutting whisper pointing as he spoke to jonathan silence
if you make a sound i shall take him and dash his brains out before your very eyes
i was appalled and was too bewildered to do or say anything
with a mocking smile he placed one hand upon my shoulder and holding me tight bared my throat with the other saying as he did so first a little refreshment to reward my exertions
you may as well be quiet it is not the first time or the second that your veins have appeased my thirst
i was bewildered and strangely enough i did not want to hinder him
i suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is when his touch is on his victim
and oh my god my god pity me
he placed his reeking lips upon my throat
her husband groaned again
she clasped his hand harder and looked at him pityingly as if he were the injured one and went on i felt my strength fading away and i was in a half swoon
how long this horrible thing lasted i know not but it seemed that a long time must have passed before he took his foul awful sneering mouth away
i saw it drip with the fresh blood
the remembrance seemed for a while to overpower her and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her husbands sustaining arm
with a great effort she recovered herself and went on then he spoke to me mockingly and so you like the others would play your brains against mine
you would help these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my designs
you know now and they know in part already and will know in full before long what it is to cross my path
they should have kept their energies for use closer to home
whilst they played wits against meagainst me who commanded nations and intrigued for them and fought for them hundreds of years before they were borni was countermining them
and you their best beloved one are now to me flesh of my flesh blood of my blood kin of my kin my bountiful winepress for a while and shall be later on my companion and my helper
you shall be avenged in turn for not one of them but shall minister to your needs
but as yet you are to be punished for what you have done
you have aided in thwarting me now you shall come to my call
when my brain says come
to you you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding and to that end this
with that he pulled open his shirt and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast
when the blood began to spurt out he took my hands in one of his holding them tight and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to the wound so that i must either suffocate or swallow some of the oh my god
what have i done
what have i done to deserve such a fate i who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days
god pity me
look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear
then she began to rub her lips as though to cleanse them from pollution
as she was telling her terrible story the eastern sky began to quicken and everything became more and more clear
harker was still and quiet but over his face as the awful narrative went on came a grey look which deepened and deepened in the morning light till when the first red streak of the coming dawn shot up the flesh stood darkly out against the whitening hair
we have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action
of this i am sure the sun rises today on no more miserable house in all the great round of its daily course
as i must do something or go mad i write this diary
it is now six oclock and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat for dr van helsing and dr seward are agreed that if we do not eat we cannot work our best
our best will be god knows required today
i must keep writing at every chance for i dare not stop to think
all big and little must go down perhaps at the end the little things may teach us most
the teaching big or little could not have landed mina or me anywhere worse than we are today
however we must trust and hope
poor mina told me just now with the tears running down her dear cheeks that it is in trouble and trial that our faith is testedthat we must keep on trusting and that god will aid us up to the end
the end
what end
to work
when dr van helsing and dr seward had come back from seeing poor renfield we went gravely into what was to be done
first dr seward told us that when he and dr van helsing had gone down to the room below they had found renfield lying on the floor all in a heap
his face was all bruised and crushed in and the bones of the neck were broken
dr seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had heard anything
he said that he had been sitting downhe confessed to half dozingwhen he heard loud voices in the room and then renfield had called out loudly several times god
after that there was a sound of falling and when he entered the room he found him lying on the floor face down just as the doctors had seen him
van helsing asked if he had heard voices or a voice and he said he could not say that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two but as there was no one in the room it could have been only one
he could swear to it if required that the word god was spoken by the patient
dr seward said to us when we were alone that he did not wish to go into the matter the question of an inquest had to be considered and it would never do to put forward the truth as no one would believe it
as it was he thought that on the attendants evidence he could give a certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed
in case the coroner should demand it there would be a formal inquest necessarily to the same result
when the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next step the very first thing we decided was that mina should be in full confidence that nothing of any sortno matter how painfulshould be kept from her
she herself agreed as to its wisdom and it was pitiful to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful and in such a depth of despair
there must be no concealment she said alas
we have had too much already
and besides there is nothing in all the world that can give me more pain than i have already enduredthan i suffer now
whatever may happen it must be of new hope or of new courage to me
van helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke and said suddenly but quietly but dear madam mina are you not afraid not for yourself but for others from yourself after what has happened
her face grew set in its lines but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she answered ah no
for my mind is made up
to what
he asked gently whilst we were all very still for each in our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant
her answer came with direct simplicity as though she were simply stating a fact because if i find in myselfand i shall watch keenly for ita sign of harm to any that i love i shall die
you would not kill yourself
he asked hoarsely
i would if there were no friend who loved me who would save me such a pain and so desperate an effort
she looked at him meaningly as she spoke
he was sitting down but now he rose and came close to her and put his hand on her head as he said solemnly my child there is such an one if it were for your good
for myself i could hold it in my account with god to find such an euthanasia for you even at this moment if it were best
nay were it safe
but my child for a moment he seemed choked and a great sob rose in his throat he gulped it down and went on there are here some who would stand between you and death
you must not die
you must not die by any hand but least of all by your own
until the other who has fouled your sweet life is true dead you must not die for if he is still with the quick undead your death would make you even as he is
no you must live
you must struggle and strive to live though death would seem a boon unspeakable
you must fight death himself though he come to you in pain or in joy by the day or the night in safety or in peril
on your living soul i charge you that you do not dienay nor think of deathtill this great evil be past
the poor dear grew white as death and shock and shivered as i have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide
we were all silent we could do nothing
at length she grew more calm and turning to him said sweetly but oh
so sorrowfully as she held out her hand i promise you my dear friend that if god will let me live i shall strive to do so till if it may be in his good time this horror may have passed away from me
she was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her and we began to discuss what we were to do
i told her that she was to have all the papers in the safe and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use and was to keep the record as she had done before
she was pleased with the prospect of anything to doif pleased could be used in connection with so grim an interest
as usual van helsing had thought ahead of everyone else and was prepared with an exact ordering of our work
it is perhaps well he said that at our meeting after our visit to carfax we decided not to do anything with the earthboxes that lay there
had we done so the count must have guessed our purpose and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the others but now he does not know our intentions
nay more in all probability he does not know that such a power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs so that he cannot use them as of old
we are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to their disposition that when we have examined the house in piccadilly we may track the very last of them
today then is ours and in it rests our hope
the sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course
until it sets tonight that monster must retain whatever form he now has
he is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope
he cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies
if he go through a doorway he must open the door like a mortal
and so we have this day to hunt out all his lairs and sterilise them
so we shall if we have not yet catch him and destroy him drive him to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be in time sure
here i started up for i could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so preciously laden with minas life and happiness were flying from us since whilst we talked action was impossible
but van helsing held up his hand warningly
nay friend jonathan he said in this the quickest way home is the longest way so your proverb say
we shall all act and act with desperate quick when the time has come
but think in all probable the key of the situation is in that house in piccadilly
the count may have many houses which he has bought
of them he will have deeds of purchase keys and other things
he will have paper that he write on he will have his book of cheques
there are many belongings that he must have somewhere why not in this place so central so quiet where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour when in the very vast of the traffic there is none to notice
we shall go there and search that house and when we learn what it holds then we do what our friend arthur call in his phrases of hunt stop the earths and so we run down our old foxso
then let us come at once i cried we are wasting the precious precious time
the professor did not move but simply said and how are we to get into that house in piccadilly
any way
we shall break in if need be
and your police where will they be and what will they say
i was staggered but i knew that if he wished to delay he had a good reason for it
so i said as quietly as i could dont wait more than need be you know i am sure what torture i am in
ah my child that i do and indeed there is no wish of me to add to your anguish
but just think what can we do until all the world be at movement
then will come our time
i have thought and thought and it seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all
now we wish to get into the house but we have no key is it not so
i nodded
now suppose that you were in truth the owner of that house and could not still get in and think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker what would you do
i should get a respectable locksmith and set him to work to pick the lock for me
and your police they would interfere would they not
not if they knew the man was properly employed
then he looked at me as keenly as he spoke all that is in doubt is the conscience of the employer and the belief of your policemen as to whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one
your police must indeed be zealous men and cleveroh so clever
in reading the heart that they trouble themselves in such matter
no no my friend jonathan you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this your london or of any city in the world and if you do it as such things are rightly done and at the time such things are rightly done no one will interfere
i have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in london and when he went for months of summer to switzerland and lock up his house some burglar came and broke window at back and got in
then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door before the very eyes of the police
then he have an auction in that house and advertise it and put up big notice and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them
then he go to a builder and he sell him that house making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time
and your police and other authority help him all they can
and when that owner come back from his holiday in switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been
this was all done en rgle and in our work we shall be en rgle too
we shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to think of shall deem it strange but we shall go after ten oclock when there are many about and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house
i could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of minas face became relaxed a thought there was hope in such good counsel
van helsing went on when once within that house we may find more clues at any rate some of us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be more earthboxesat bermondsey and mile end
lord godalming stood up
i can be of some use here he said
i shall wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most convenient
look here old fellow said morris it is a capital idea to have all ready in case we want to go horsebacking but dont you think that one of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of walworth or mile end would attract too much attention for our purposes
it seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east and even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to
friend quincey is right
said the professor
his head is what you call in plane with the horizon
it is a difficult thing that we go to do and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may
mina took a growing interest in everything and i was rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night
she was very very palealmost ghastly and so thin that her lips were drawn away showing her teeth in somewhat of prominence
i did not mention this last lest it should give her needless pain but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor lucy when the count had sucked her blood
as yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper but the time as yet was short and there was time for fear
when we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the disposition of our forces there were new sources of doubt
it was finally agreed that before starting for piccadilly we should destroy the counts lair close at hand
in case he should find it out too soon we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction and his presence in his purely material shape and at his weakest might give us some new clue
as to the disposal of forces it was suggested by the professor that after our visit to carfax we should all enter the house in piccadilly that the two doctors and i should remain there whilst lord godalming and quincey found the lairs at walworth and mile end and destroyed them
it was possible if not likely the professor urged that the count might appear in piccadilly during the day and that if so we might be able to cope with him then and there
at any rate we might be able to follow him in force
to this plan i strenuously objected and so far as my going was concerned for i said that i intended to stay and protect mina i thought that my mind was made up on the subject but mina would not listen to my objection
she said that there might be some law matter in which i could be useful that amongst the counts papers might be some clue which i could understand out of my experience in transylvania and that as it was all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the counts extraordinary power
i had to give in for minas resolution was fixed she said that it was the last hope for her that we should all work together
as for me she said i have no fear
things have been as bad as they can be and whatever may happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort
go my husband
god can if he wishes it guard me as well alone as with any one present
so i started up crying out then in gods name let us come at once for we are losing time
the count may come to piccadilly earlier than we think
said van helsing holding up his hand
do you forget he said with actually a smile that last night he banqueted heavily and will sleep late
did i forget
shall i evercan i ever
can any of us ever forget that terrible scene
mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance but the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face and shuddered whilst she moaned
van helsing had not intended to recall her frightful experience
he had simply lost sight of her and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort
when it struck him what he said he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her
oh madam mina he said dear dear madam mina alas
that i of all who so reverence you should have said anything so forgetful
these stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so but you will forget it will you not
he bent low beside her as he spoke she took his hand and looking at him through her tears said hoarsely no i shall not forget for it is well that i remember and with it i have so much in memory of you that is sweet that i take it all together
now you must all be going soon
breakfast is ready and we must all eat that we may be strong
breakfast was a strange meal to us all
we tried to be cheerful and encourage each other and mina was the brightest and most cheerful of us
when it was over van helsing stood up and said now my dear friends we go forth to our terrible enterprise
are we all armed as we were on that night when first we visited our enemys lair armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack
we all assured him
then it is well
now madam mina you are in any case quite safe here until the sunset and before then we shall returnif we shall return
but before we go let me see you armed against personal attack
i have myself since you came down prepared your chamber by the placing of things of which we know so that he may not enter
now let me guard yourself
on your forehead i touch this piece of sacred wafer in the name of the father the son and there was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear
as he had placed the wafer on minas forehead it had seared ithad burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of whitehot metal
my poor darlings brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as her nerves received the pain of it and the two so overwhelmed her that her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream
but the words to her thought came quickly the echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came the reaction and she sank on her knees on the floor in an agony of abasement
pulling her beautiful hair over her face as the leper of old his mantle she wailed out unclean
unclean
even the almighty shuns my polluted flesh
i must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the judgment day
they all paused
i had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless grief and putting my arms around held her tight
for a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that ran tears silently
then van helsing turned and said gravely so gravely that i could not help feeling that he was in some way inspired and was stating things outside himself it may be that you may have to bear that mark till god himself see fit as he most surely shall on the judgment day to redress all wrongs of the earth and of his children that he has placed thereon
and oh madam mina my dear my dear may we who love you be there to see when that red scar the sign of gods knowledge of what has been shall pass away and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know
for so surely as we live that scar shall pass away when god sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us
till then we bear our cross as his son did in obedience to his will
it may be that we are chosen instruments of his good pleasure and that we ascend to his bidding as that other through stripes and shame through tears and blood through doubts and fears and all that makes the difference between god and man
there was hope in his words and comfort and they made for resignation
mina and i both felt so and simultaneously we each took one of the old mans hands and bent over and kissed it
then without a word we all knelt down together and all holding hands swore to be true to each other
we men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of her whom each in his own way we loved and we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us
it was then time to start
so i said farewell to mina a parting which neither of us shall forget to our dying day and we set out
to one thing i have made up my mind if we find out that mina must be a vampire in the end then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible land alone
i suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant many just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks
we entered carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on the first occasion
it was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew
had not our minds been made up and had there not been terrible memories to spur us on we could hardly have proceeded with our task
we found no papers or any sign of use in the house and in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last
dr van helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them and now my friends we have a duty here to do
we must sterilise this earth so sacred of holy memories that he has brought from a far distant land for such fell use
he has chosen this earth because it has been holy
thus we defeat him with his own weapon for we make it more holy still
it was sanctified to such use of man now we sanctify it to god
as he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open
the earth smelled musty and close but we did not somehow seem to mind for our attention was concentrated on the professor
taking from his box a piece of the sacred wafer he laid it reverently on the earth and then shutting down the lid began to screw it home we aiding him as he worked
one by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes and left them as we had found them to all appearance but in each was a portion of the host
when we closed the door behind us the professor said solemnly so much is already done
if it may be that with all the others we can be so successful then the sunset of this evening may shine on madam minas forehead all white as ivory and with no stain
as we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum
i looked eagerly and in the window of my own room saw mina
i waved my hand to her and nodded to tell that our work there was successfully accomplished
she nodded in reply to show that she understood
the last i saw she was waving her hand in farewell
it was with a heavy heart that we sought the station and just caught the train which was steaming in as we reached the platform
i have written this in the train
piccadilly 1230 oclock
just before we reached fenchurch street lord godalming said to me quincey and i will find a locksmith
you had better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty for under the circumstances it wouldnt seem so bad for us to break into an empty house
but you are a solicitor and the incorporated law society might tell you that you should have known better
i demurred as to my not sharing any danger even of odium but he went on besides it will attract less attention if there are not too many of us
my title will make it all right with the locksmith and with any policeman that may come along
you had better go with jack and the professor and stay in the green park somewhere in sight of the house and when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away do you all come across
we shall be on the lookout for you and shall let you in
the advice is good
said van helsing so we said no more
godalming and morris hurried off in a cab we following in another
at the corner of arlington street our contingent got out and strolled into the green park
my heart beat as i saw the house on which so much of our hope was centred looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its more lively and sprucelooking neighbours
we sat down on a bench within good view and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible
the minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the others
at length we saw a fourwheeler drive up
out of it in leisurely fashion got lord godalming and morris and down from the box descended a thickset working man with his rushwoven basket of tools
morris paid the cabman who touched his hat and drove away
together the two ascended the steps and lord godalming pointed out what he wanted done
the workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered along
the policeman nodded acquiescence and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him
after searching through it he took out a selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly fashion
then he stood up looked into the keyhole blew into it and turning to his employers made some remark
lord godalming smiled and the man lifted a goodsized bunch of keys selecting one of them he began to probe the lock as if feeling his way with it
after fumbling about for a bit he tried a second and then a third
all at once the door opened under a slight push from him and he and the two others entered the hall
we sat still my own cigar burnt furiously but van helsings went cold altogether
we waited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring in his bag
then he held the door partly open steadying it with his knees whilst he fitted a key to the lock
this he finally handed to lord godalming who took out his purse and gave him something
the man touched his hat took his bag put on his coat and departed not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction
when the man had fairly gone we three crossed the street and knocked at the door
it was immediately opened by quincey morris beside whom stood lord godalming lighting a cigar
the place smells so vilely said the latter as we came in
it did indeed smell vilelylike the old chapel at carfaxand with our previous experience it was plain to us that the count had been using the place pretty freely
we moved to explore the house all keeping together in case of attack for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal with and as yet we did not know whether the count might not be in the house
in the diningroom which lay at the back of the hall we found eight boxes of earth
eight boxes only out of the nine which we sought
our work was not over and would never be until we should have found the missing box
first we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a narrow stoneflagged yard at the blank face of a stable pointed to look like the front of a miniature house
there were no windows in it so we were not afraid of being overlooked
we did not lose any time in examining the chests
with the tools which we had brought with us we opened them one by one and treated them as we had treated those others in the old chapel
it was evident to us that the count was not at present in the house and we proceeded to search for any of his effects
after a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms from basement to attic we came to the conclusion that the diningroom contained any effects which might belong to the count and so we proceeded to minutely examine them
they lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great diningroom table
there were title deeds of the piccadilly house in a great bundle deeds of the purchase of the houses at mile end and bermondsey notepaper envelopes and pens and ink
all were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust
there were also a clothes brush a brush and comb and a jug and basinthe latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood
last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes probably those belonging to the other houses
when we had examined this last find lord godalming and quincey morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the east and the south took with them the keys in a great bunch and set out to destroy the boxes in these places
the rest of us are with what patience we can waiting their returnor the coming of the count
the time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for the coming of godalming and quincey morris
the professor tried to keep our minds active by using them all the time
i could see his beneficent purpose by the side glances which he threw from time to time at harker
the poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see
last night he was a frank happylooking man with strong youthful face full of energy and with dark brown hair
today he is a drawn haggard old man whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and griefwritten lines of his face
his energy is still intact in fact he is like a living flame
this may yet be his salvation for if all go well it will tide him over the despairing period he will then in a kind of way wake again to the realities of life
poor fellow i thought my own trouble was bad enough but his
the professor knows this well enough and is doing his best to keep his mind active
what he has been saying was under the circumstances of absorbing interest
so well as i can remember here it is i have studied over and over again since they came into my hands all the papers relating to this monster and the more i have studied the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out
all through there are signs of his advance not only of his power but of his knowledge of it
as i learned from the researches of my friend arminus of budapesth he was in life a most wonderful man
soldier statesman and alchemistwhich latter was the highest development of the scienceknowledge of his time
he had a mighty brain a learning beyond compare and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse
he dared even to attend the scholomance and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay
well in him the brain powers survived the physical death though it would seem that memory was not all complete
in some faculties of mind he has been and is only a child but he is growing and some things that were childish at the first are now of mans stature
he is experimenting and doing it well and if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yethe may be yet if we failthe father or furtherer of a new order of beings whose road must lead through death not life
harker groaned and said and this is all arrayed against my darling
but how is he experimenting
the knowledge may help us to defeat him
he has all along since his coming been trying his power slowly but surely that big childbrain of his is working
well for us it is as yet a childbrain for had he dared at the first to attempt certain things he would long ago have been beyond our power
however he means to succeed and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow
festina lente may well be his motto
i fail to understand said harker wearily
oh do be more plain to me
perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain
the professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke ah my child i will be plain
do you not see how of late this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally
how he has been making use of the zophagous patient to effect his entry into friend johns home for your vampire though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by an inmate
but these are not his most important experiments
do we not see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others
he knew not then but that must be so
but all the time that so great childbrain of his was growing and he began to consider whether he might not himself move the box
so he began to help and then when he found that this be allright he try to move them all alone
and so he progress and he scatter these graves of him and none but he know where they are hidden
he may have intend to bury them deep in the ground
so that he only use them in the night or at such time as he can change his form they do him equal well and none may know these are his hidingplace
but my child do not despair this knowledge come to him just too late
already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him and before the sunset this shall be so
then he have no place where he can move and hide
i delayed this morning that so we might be sure
is there not more at stake for us than for him
then why we not be even more careful than him
by my clock it is one hour and already if all be well friend arthur and quincey are on their way to us
today is our day and we must go sure if slow and lose no chance
there are five of us when those absent ones return
whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door the double postmans knock of the telegraph boy
we all moved out to the hall with one impulse and van helsing holding up his hand to us to keep silence stepped to the door and opened it
the boy handed in a despatch
the professor closed the door again and after looking at the direction opened it and read aloud
look out for d
he has just now 1245 come from carfax hurriedly and hastened towards the south
he seems to be going the round and may want to see you mina
there was a pause broken by jonathan harkers voice now god be thanked we shall soon meet
van helsing turned to him quickly and said god will act in his own way and time
do not fear and do not rejoice as yet for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings
i care for nothing now he answered hotly except to wipe out this brute from the face of creation
i would sell my soul to do it
oh hush hush my child
god does not purchase souls in this wise and the devil though he may purchase does not keep faith
but god is merciful and just and knows your pain and your devotion to that dear madam mina
think you how her pain would be doubled did she but hear your wild words
do not fear any of us we are all devoted to this cause and today shall see the end
the time is coming for action today this vampire is limit to the powers of man and till sunset he may not change
it will take him time to arrive heresee it is twenty minutes past oneand there are yet some times before he can hither come be he never so quick
what we must hope for is that my lord arthur and quincey arrive first
about half an hour after we had received mr
harkers telegram there came a quiet resolute knock at the hall door
it was just an ordinary knock such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen but it made the professors heart and mine beat loudly
we looked at each other and together moved out into the hall we each held ready to use our various armamentsthe spiritual in the left hand the mortal in the right
van helsing pulled back the latch and holding the door half open stood back having both hands ready for action
the gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when on the step close to the door we saw lord godalming and quincey morris
they came quickly in and closed the door behind them the former saying as they moved along the hall it is all right
we found both places six boxes in each and we destroyed them all
destroyed
for him
we were silent for a minute and then quincey said theres nothing to do but to wait here
if however he doesnt turn up by five oclock we must start off for it wont do to leave mr
harker alone after sunset
he will be here before long now said van helsing who had been consulting his pocketbook
nota bene in madams telegram he went south from carfax that means he went to cross the river and he could only do so at slack of tide which should be something before one oclock
that he went south has a meaning for us
he is as yet only suspicious and he went from carfax first to the place where he would suspect interference least
you must have been at bermondsey only a short time before him
that he is not here already shows that he went to mile end next
this took him some time for he would then have to be carried over the river in some way
believe me my friends we shall not have long to wait now
we should have ready some plan of attack so that we may throw away no chance
hush there is no time now
have all your arms
be ready
he held up a warning hand as he spoke for we all could hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door
i could not but admire even at such a moment the way in which a dominant spirit asserted itself
in all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world quincey morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action and arthur and i had been accustomed to obey him implicitly
now the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively
with a swift glance around the room he at once laid out our plan of attack and without speaking a word with a gesture placed us each in position
van helsing harker and i were just behind the door so that when it was opened the professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door
godalming behind and quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window
we waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness
the slow careful steps came along the hall the count was evidently prepared for some surpriseat least he feared it
suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room winning a way past us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him
there was something so pantherlike in the movementsomething so unhuman that it seemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming
the first to act was harker who with a quick movement threw himself before the door leading into the room in the front of the house
as the count saw us a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face showing the eyeteeth long and pointed but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of lionlike disdain
his expression again changed as with a single impulse we all advanced upon him
it was a pity that we had not some better organised plan of attack for even at the moment i wondered what we were to do
i did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would avail us anything
harker evidently meant to try the matter for he had ready his great kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him
the blow was a powerful one only the diabolical quickness of the counts leap back saved him
a second less and the trenchant blade had shorne through his heart
as it was the point just cut the cloth of his coat making a wide gap whence a bundle of banknotes and a stream of gold fell out
the expression of the counts face was so hellish that for a moment i feared for harker though i saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke
instinctively i moved forward with a protective impulse holding the crucifix and wafer in my left hand
i felt a mighty power fly along my arm and it was without surprise that i saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us
it would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignityof anger and hellish ragewhich came over the counts face
his waxen hue became greenishyellow by the contrast of his burning eyes and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound
the next instant with a sinuous dive he swept under harkers arm ere his blow could fall and grasping a handful of the money from the floor dashed across the room threw himself at the window
amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass he tumbled into the flagged area below
through the sound of the shivering glass i could hear the ting of the gold as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging
we ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground
he rushing up the steps crossed the flagged yard and pushed open the stable door
there he turned and spoke to us you think to baffle me youwith your pale faces all in a row like sheep in a butchers
you shall be sorry yet each one of you
you think you have left me without a place to rest but i have more
my revenge is just begun
i spread it over centuries and time is on my side
your girls that you all love are mine already and through them you and others shall yet be minemy creatures to do my bidding and to be my jackals when i want to feed
with a contemptuous sneer he passed quickly through the door and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he fastened it behind him
a door beyond opened and shut
the first of us to speak was the professor as realising the difficulty of following him through the stable we moved toward the hall
we have learnt somethingmuch
notwithstanding his brave words he fears us he fear time he fear want
for if not why he hurry so
his very tone betray him or my ears deceive
why take that money
you follow quick
you are hunters of wild beast and understand it so
for me i make sure that nothing here may be of use to him if so that he return
as he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket took the titledeeds in the bundle as harker had left them and swept the remaining things into the open fireplace where he set fire to them with a match
godalming and morris had rushed out into the yard and harker had lowered himself from the window to follow the count
he had however bolted the stable door and by the time they had forced it open there was no sign of him
van helsing and i tried to make inquiry at the back of the house but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart
it was now late in the afternoon and sunset was not far off
we had to recognise that our game was up with heavy hearts we agreed with the professor when he said let us go back to madam minapoor poor dear madam mina
all we can do just now is done and we can there at least protect her
but we need not despair
there is but one more earthbox and we must try to find it when that is done all may yet be well
i could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort harker
the poor fellow was quite broken down now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppresshe was thinking of his wife
with sad hearts we came back to my house where we found mr
harker waiting us with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her bravery and unselfishness
when she saw our faces her own became as pale as death for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were in secret prayer and then she said cheerfully i can never thank you all enough
oh my poor darling
as she spoke she took her husbands grey head in her hands and kissed itlay your poor head here and rest it
all will yet be well dear
god will protect us if he so will it in his good intent
the poor fellow groaned
there was no place for words in his sublime misery
we had a sort of perfunctory supper together and i think it cheered us all up somewhat
it was perhaps the mere animal heat of food to hungry peoplefor none of us had eaten anything since breakfastor the sense of companionship may have helped us but anyhow we were all less miserable and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope
true to our promise we told mr
harker everything which had passed and although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband and red at others when his devotion to her was manifested she listened bravely and with calmness
when we came to the part where harker had rushed at the count so recklessly she clung to her husbands arm and held it tight as though her clinging could protect him from any harm that might come
she said nothing however till the narration was all done and matters had been brought right up to the present time
then without letting go her husbands hand she stood up amongst us and spoke
oh that i could give any idea of the scene of that sweet sweet good good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and animation with the red scar on her forehead of which she was conscious and which we saw with grinding of our teethremembering whence and how it came her loving kindness against our grim hate her tender faith against all our fears and doubting and we knowing that so far as symbols went she with all her goodness and purity and faith was outcast from god
jonathan she said and the word sounded like music on her lips it was so full of love and tenderness jonathan dear and you all my true true friends i want you to bear something in mind through all this dreadful time
i know that you must fightthat you must destroy even as you destroyed the false lucy so that the true lucy might live hereafter but it is not a work of hate
that poor soul who has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all
just think what will be his joy when he too is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have spiritual immortality
you must be pitiful to him too though it may not hold your hands from his destruction
as she spoke i could see her husbands face darken and draw together as though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core
instinctively the clasp on his wifes hand grew closer till his knuckles looked white
she did not flinch from the pain which i knew she must have suffered but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing than ever
as she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet almost tearing his hand from hers as he spoke may god give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that earthly life of him which we are aiming at
if beyond it i could send his soul for ever and ever to burning hell i would do it
oh hush
in the name of the good god
dont say such things jonathan my husband or you will crush me with fear and horror
just think my deari have been thinking all this long long day of itthat
perhaps
some day
i too may need such pity and that some other like youand with equal cause for angermay deny it to me
oh my husband
my husband indeed i would have spared you such a thought had there been another way but i pray that god may not have treasured your wild words except as the heartbroken wail of a very loving and sorely stricken man
oh god let these poor white hairs go in evidence of what he has suffered who all his life has done no wrong and on whom so many sorrows have come
we men were all in tears now
there was no resisting them and we wept openly
she wept too to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed
her husband flung himself on his knees beside her and putting his arms round her hid his face in the folds of her dress
van helsing beckoned to us and we stole out of the room leaving the two loving hearts alone with their god
before they retired the professor fixed up the room against any coming of the vampire and assured mr
harker that she might rest in peace
she tried to school herself to the belief and manifestly for her husbands sake tried to seem content
it was a brave struggle and was i think and believe not without its reward
van helsing had placed at hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency
when they had retired quincey godalming and i arranged that we should sit up dividing the night between us and watch over the safety of the poor stricken lady
the first watch falls to quincey so the rest of us shall be off to bed as soon as we can
godalming has already turned in for his is the second watch
now that my work is done i too shall go to bed
34 october close to midnight
i thought yesterday would never end
there was over me a yearning for sleep in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find things changed and that any change must now be for the better
before we parted we discussed what our next step was to be but we could arrive at no result
all we knew was that one earthbox remained and that the count alone knew where it was
if he chooses to lie hidden he may baffle us for years and in the meantime
the thought is too horrible i dare not think of it even now
this i know that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection that one is my poor wronged darling
i love her a thousand times more for her sweet pity of last night a pity that made my own hate of the monster seem despicable
surely god will not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature
this is hope to me
we are all drifting reefwards now and faith is our only anchor
mina is sleeping and sleeping without dreams
i fear what her dreams might be like with such terrible memories to ground them in
she has not been so calm within my seeing since the sunset
then for a while there came over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of march
i thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her face but somehow now i think it has a deeper meaning
i am not sleepy myself though i am wearyweary to death
however i must try to sleep for there is tomorrow to think of and there is no rest for me until
i must have fallen asleep for i was awaked by mina who was sitting up in bed with a startled look on her face
i could see easily for we did not leave the room in darkness she had placed a warning hand over my mouth and now she whispered in my ear hush
there is someone in the corridor
i got up softly and crossing the room gently opened the door
just outside stretched on a mattress lay mr morris wide awake
he raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me hush
go back to bed it is all right
one of us will be here all night
we dont mean to take any chances
his look and gesture forbade discussion so i came back and told mina
she sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor pale face as she put her arms round me and said softly oh thank god for good brave men
with a sigh she sank back again to sleep
i write this now as i am not sleepy though i must try again
4 october morning
once again during the night i was wakened by mina
this time we had all had a good sleep for the grey of the coming dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs and the gas flame was like a speck rather than a disc of light
she said to me hurriedly go call the professor
i want to see him at once
why
i have an idea
i suppose it must have come in the night and matured without my knowing it
he must hypnotise me before the dawn and then i shall be able to speak
go quick dearest the time is getting close
i went to the door
dr seward was resting on the mattress and seeing me he sprang to his feet
is anything wrong
he asked in alarm
no i replied but mina wants to see dr van helsing at once
i will go he said and hurried into the professors room
in two or three minutes later van helsing was in the room in his dressinggown and mr morris and lord godalming were with dr seward at the door asking questions
when the professor saw mina smilea positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face he rubbed his hands as he said oh my dear madam mina this is indeed a change
friend jonathan we have got our dear madam mina as of old back to us today
then turning to her he said cheerfully and what am i do for you
for at this hour you do not want me for nothings
i want you to hypnotise me
do it before the dawn for i feel that then i can speak and speak freely
be quick for the time is short
without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed
looking fixedly at her he commenced to make passes in front of her from over the top of her head downward with each hand in turn
mina gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer for i felt that some crisis was at hand
gradually her eyes closed and she sat stock still only by the gentle heaving of her bosom could one know that she was alive
the professor made a few more passes and then stopped and i could see that his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration
mina opened her eyes but she did not seem the same woman
there was a faraway look in her eyes and her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me
raising his hand to impose silence the professor motioned to me to bring the others in
they came on tiptoe closing the door behind them and stood at the foot of the bed looking on
mina appeared not to see them
the stillness was broken by van helsings voice speaking in a low level tone which would not break the current of her thoughts where are you
the answer came in a neutral way i do not know
sleep has no place it can call its own
for several minutes there was silence
mina sat rigid and the professor stood staring at her fixedly the rest of us hardly dared to breathe
the room was growing lighter without taking his eyes from minas face dr van helsing motioned me to pull up the blind
i did so and the day seemed just upon us
a red streak shot up and a rosy light seemed to diffuse itself through the room
on the instant the professor spoke again where are you now
the answer came dreamily but with intention it were as though she were interpreting something
i have heard her use the same tone when reading her shorthand notes
it is all strange to me
what do you see
i can see nothing it is all dark
what do you hear
i could detect the strain in the professors patient voice
the lapping of water
it is gurgling by and little waves leap
i can hear them on the outside
then you are on a ship
we all looked at each other trying to glean something each from the other
we were afraid to think
the answer came quick oh yes
what else do you hear
the sound of men stamping overhead as they run about
there is the creaking of a chain and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan falls into the rachet
i am stilloh so still
it is like death
the voice faded away into a deep breath as of one sleeping and the open eyes closed again
by this time the sun had risen and we were all in the full light of day
dr van helsing placed his hands on minas shoulders and laid her head down softly on her pillow
she lay like a sleeping child for a few moments and then with a long sigh awoke and stared in wonder to see us all around her
have i been talking in my sleep
was all she said
she seemed however to know the situation without telling though she was eager to know what she had told
the professor repeated the conversation and she said then there is not a moment to lose it may not be yet too late
mr morris and lord godalming started for the door but the professors calm voice called them back stay my friends
that ship wherever it was was weighing anchor whilst she spoke
there are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in your so great port of london
which of them is it that you seek
god be thanked that we have once again a clue though whither it may lead us we know not
we have been blind somewhat blind after the manner of men since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen
alas but that sentence is a puddle is it not
we can know now what was in the counts mind when he seize that money though jonathans so fierce knife put him in the danger that even he dread
he meant escape
hear me escape
he saw that with but one earthbox left and a pack of men following like dogs after a fox this london was no place for him
he have take his last earthbox on board a ship and he leave the land
he think to escape but no
we follow him
tally ho
as friend arthur would say when he put on his red frock
our old fox is wily oh
so wily and we must follow with wile
i too am wily and i think his mind in a little while
in meantime we may rest and in peace for there are waters between us which he do not want to pass and which he could not if he wouldunless the ship were to touch the land and then only at full or slack tide
see and the sun is just rose and all day to sunset is to us
let us take bath and dress and have breakfast which we all need and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with us
mina looked at him appealingly as she asked but why need we seek him further when he is gone away from us
he took her hand and patted it as he replied ask me nothings as yet
when we have breakfast then i answer all questions
he would say no more and we separated to dress
after breakfast mina repeated her question
he looked at her gravely for a minute and then said sorrowfully because my dear dear madam mina now more than ever must we find him even if we have to follow him to the jaws of hell
she grew paler as she asked faintly why
because he answered solemnly he can live for centuries and you are but mortal woman
time is now to be dreadedsince once he put that mark upon your throat
i was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint
you are to stay with your dear madam mina
we shall go to make our searchif i can call it so for it is not search but knowing and we seek confirmation only
but do you stay and take care of her today
this is your best and most holiest office
this day nothing can find him here
let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already for i have tell them
he our enemy have gone away he have gone back to his castle in transylvania
i know it so well as if a great hand of fire wrote it on the wall
he have prepare for this in some way and that last earthbox was ready to ship somewheres
for this he took the money for this he hurry at the last lest we catch him before the sun go down
it was his last hope save that he might hide in the tomb that he think poor miss lucy being as he thought like him keep open to him
but there was not of time
when that fail he make straight for his last resourcehis last earthwork i might say did i wish double entente
he is clever oh so clever
he know that his game here was finish and so he decide he go back home
he find ship going by the route he came and he go in it
we go off now to find what ship and whither bound when we have discover that we come back and tell you all
then we will comfort you and poor dear madam mina with new hope
for it will be hope when you think it over that all is not lost
this very creature that we pursue he take hundreds of years to get so far as london and yet in one day when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out
he is finite though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do
but we are strong each in our purpose and we are all more strong together
take heart afresh dear husband of madam mina
this battle is but begun and in the end we shall winso sure as that god sits on high to watch over his children
therefore be of much comfort till we return
4 october
when i read to mina van helsings message in the phonograph the poor girl brightened up considerably
already the certainty that the count is out of the country has given her comfort and comfort is strength to her
for my own part now that his horrible danger is not face to face with us it seems almost impossible to believe in it
even my own terrible experiences in castle dracula seem like a longforgotten dream
here in the crisp autumn air in the bright sunlight alas
how can i disbelieve
in the midst of my thought my eye fell on the red scar on my poor darlings white forehead
whilst that lasts there can be no disbelief
and afterwards the very memory of it will keep faith crystal clear
mina and i fear to be idle so we have been over all the diaries again and again
somehow although the reality seems greater each time the pain and the fear seem less
there is something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout which is comforting
mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good
it may be
i shall try to think as she does
we have never spoken to each other yet of the future
it is better to wait till we see the professor and the others after their investigations
the day is running by more quickly than i ever thought a day could run for me again
it is now three oclock
5 october 5 pm our meeting for report
present professor van helsing lord godalming dr seward mr quincey morris jonathan harker mina harker
dr van helsing described what steps were taken during the day to discover on what boat and whither bound count dracula made his escape as i knew that he wanted to get back to transylvania i felt sure that he must go by the danube mouth or by somewhere in the black sea since by that way he come
it was a dreary blank that was before us
omne ignotum pro magnifico and so with heavy hearts we start to find what ships leave for the black sea last night
he was in sailing ship since madam mina tell of sails being set
these not so important as to go in your list of the shipping in the times and so we go by suggestion of lord godalming to your lloyds where are note of all ships that sail however so small
there we find that only one blackseabound ship go out with the tide
she is the czarina catherine and she sail from doolittles wharf for varna and thence on to other parts and up the danube
soh
said i this is the ship whereon is the count
so off we go to doolittles wharf and there we find a man in an office of wood so small that the man look bigger than the office
from him we inquire of the goings of the czarina catherine
he swear much and he red face and loud of voice but he good fellow all the same and when quincey give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up and put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing he still better fellow and humble servant to us
he come with us and ask many men who are rough and hot these be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty
they say much of blood and bloom and of others which i comprehend not though i guess what they mean but nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know
they make known to us among them how last afternoon at about five oclock comes a man so hurry
a tall man thin and pale with high nose and teeth so white and eyes that seem to be burning
that he be all in black except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the time
that he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the black sea and for where
some took him to the office and then to the ship where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gangplank and ask that the captain come to him
the captain come when told that he will be pay well and though he swear much at the first he agree to term
then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired
he go there and soon he come again himself driving cart on which a great box this he himself lift down though it take several to put it on truck for the ship
he give much talk to captain as to how and where his box is to be place but the captain like it not and swear at him in many tongues and tell him that if he like he can come and see where it shall be
but he say no that he come not yet for that he have much to do
whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quickwith bloodfor that his ship will leave the placeof bloodbefore the turn of the tidewith blood
then the thin man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon
the captain swear again polyglot and the thin man make him bow and thank him and say that he will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing
final the captain more red than ever and in more tongues tell him that he doesnt want no frenchmenwith bloom upon them and also with bloodin his shipwith blood on her also
and so after asking where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship forms he departed
no one knew where he went or bloomin well cared as they said for they had something else to think ofwell with blood again for it soon became apparent to all that the czarina catherine would not sail as was expected
a thin mist began to creep up from the river and it grew and grew till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her
the captain swore polyglotvery polyglotpolyglot with bloom and blood but he could do nothing
the water rose and rose and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether
he was in no friendly mood when just at full tide the thin man came up the gangplank again and asked to see where his box had been stowed
then the captain replied that he wished that he and his boxold and with much bloom and bloodwere in hell
but the thin man did not be offend and went down with the mate and saw where it was place and came up and stood awhile on deck in fog
he must have come off by himself for none notice him
indeed they thought not of him for soon the fog begin to melt away and all was clear again
my friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom and blood laughed as they told how the captains swears exceeded even his usual polyglot and was more than ever full of picturesque when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up and down on the river that hour he found that few of them had seen any of fog at all except where it lay round the wharf
however the ship went out on the ebb tide and was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth
she was by then when they told us well out to sea
and so my dear madam mina it is that we have to rest for a time for our enemy is on the sea with the fog at his command on his way to the danube mouth
to sail a ship takes time go she never so quick and when we start we go on land more quick and we meet him there
our best hope is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset for then he can make no struggle and we may deal with him as we should
there are days for us in which we can make ready our plan
we know all about where he go for we have seen the owner of the ship who have shown us invoices and all papers that can be
the box we seek is to be landed in varna and to be given to an agent one ristics who will there present his credentials and so our merchant friend will have done his part
when he ask if there be any wrong for that so he can telegraph and have inquiry made at varna we say no for what is to be done is not for police or of the customs
it must be done by us alone and in our own way
when dr van helsing had done speaking i asked him if he were certain that the count had remained on board the ship
he replied we have the best proof of that your own evidence when in the hypnotic trance this morning
i asked him again if it were really necessary that they should pursue the count for oh
i dread jonathan leaving me and i know that he would surely go if the others went
he answered in growing passion at first quietly
as he went on however he grew more angry and more forceful till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst men yes it is necessarynecessarynecessary
for your sake in the first and then for the sake of humanity
this monster has done much harm already in the narrow scope where he find himself and in the short time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in darkness and not knowing
all this have i told these others you my dear madam mina will learn it in the phonograph of my friend john or in that of your husband
i have told them how the measure of leaving his own barren landbarren of peoplesand coming to a new land where life of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn was the work of centuries
were another of the undead like him to try to do what he has done perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have been or that will be could aid him
with this one all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in some wondrous way
the very place where he have been alive undead for all these centuries is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world
there are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither
there have been volcanoes some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties and gases that kill or make to vivify
doubtless there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way and in himself were from the first some great qualities
in a hard and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve more subtle brain more braver heart than any man
in him some vital principle have in strange way found their utmost and as his body keep strong and grow and thrive so his brain grow too
all this without that diabolic aid which is surely to him for it have to yield to the powers that come from and are symbolic of good
and now this is what he is to us
he have infect youoh forgive me my dear that i must say such but it is for good of you that i speak
he infect you in such wise that even if he do no more you have only to liveto live in your own old sweet way and so in time death which is of mans common lot and with gods sanction shall make you like to him
this must not be
we have sworn together that it must not
thus are we ministers of gods own wish that the world and men for whom his son die will not be given over to monsters whose very existence would defame him
he have allowed us to redeem one soul already and we go out as the old knights of the cross to redeem more
like them we shall travel towards the sunrise and like them if we fall we fall in good cause
he paused and i said but will not the count take his rebuff wisely
since he has been driven from england will he not avoid it as a tiger does the village from which he has been hunted
he said your simile of the tiger good for me and i shall adopt him
your maneater as they of india call the tiger who has once tasted blood of the human care no more for the other prey but prowl unceasing till he get him
this that we hunt from our village is a tiger too a maneater and he never cease to prowl
nay in himself he is not one to retire and stay afar
in his life his living life he go over the turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground he be beaten back but did he stay
he come again and again and again
look at his persistence and endurance
with the childbrain that was to him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city
what does he do
he find out the place of all the world most of promise for him
then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task
he find in patience just how is his strength and what are his powers
he study new tongues
he learn new social life new environment of old ways the politic the law the finance the science the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be since he was
his glimpse that he have had whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire
nay it help him to grow as to his brain for it all prove to him how right he was at the first in his surmises
he have done this alone all alone
from a ruin tomb in a forgotten land
what more may he not do when the greater world of thought is open to him
he that can smile at death as we know him who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole peoples
oh if such an one was to come from god and not the devil what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours
but we are pledged to set the world free
our toil must be in silence and our efforts all in secret for in this enlightened age when men believe not even what they see the doubting of wise men would be his greatest strength
it would be at once his sheath and his armour and his weapons to destroy us his enemies who are willing to peril even our own souls for the safety of one we lovefor the good of mankind and for the honour and glory of god
after a general discussion it was determined that for tonight nothing be definitely settled that we should all sleep on the facts and try to think out the proper conclusions
tomorrow at breakfast we are to meet again and after making our conclusions known to one another we shall decide on some definite cause of action
i feel a wonderful peace and rest tonight
it is as if some haunting presence were removed from me
my surmise was not finished could not be for i caught sight in the mirror of the red mark upon my forehead and i knew that i was still unclean
5 october
we all rose early and i think that sleep did much for each and all of us
when we met at early breakfast there was more general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience again
it is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature
let any obstructing cause no matter what be removed in any wayeven by deathand we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment
more than once as we sat around the table my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream
it was only when i caught sight of the red blotch on mr
harkers forehead that i was brought back to reality
even now when i am gravely revolving the matter it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our trouble is still existent
even mr
harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells it is only now and again when something recalls it to her mind that she thinks of her terrible scar
we are to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action
i see only one immediate difficulty i know it by instinct rather than reason we shall all have to speak frankly and yet i fear that in some mysterious way poor mr
harkers tongue is tied
i know that she forms conclusions of her own and from all that has been i can guess how brilliant and how true they must be but she will not or cannot give them utterance
i have mentioned this to van helsing and he and i are to talk it over when we are alone
i suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work
the count had his own purposes when he gave her what van helsing called the vampires baptism of blood
well there may be a poison that distils itself out of good things in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder at anything
one thing i know that if my instinct be true regarding poor mr
harkers silences then there is a terrible difficultyan unknown dangerin the work before us
the same power that compels her silence may compel her speech
i dare not think further for so i should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman
van helsing is coming to my study a little before the others
i shall try to open the subject with him
when the professor came in we talked over the state of things
i could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to say but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject
after beating about the bush a little he said suddenly friend john there is something that you and i must talk of alone just at the first at any rate
later we may have to take the others into our confidence then he stopped so i waited he went on madam mina our poor dear madam mina is changing
a cold shiver ran through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed
van helsing continued with the sad experience of miss lucy we must this time be warned before things go too far
our task is now in reality more difficult than ever and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance
i can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face
it is now but very very slight but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without to prejudge
her teeth are some sharper and at times her eyes are more hard
but these are not all there is to her the silence now often as so it was with miss lucy
she did not speak even when she wrote that which she wished to be known later
now my fear is this
if it be that she can by our hypnotic trance tell what the count see and hear is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his should if he will compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know
i nodded acquiescence he went on then what we must do is to prevent this we must keep her ignorant of our intent and so she cannot tell what she know not
this is a painful task
oh so painful that it heartbreak me to think of but it must be
when today we meet i must tell her that for reason which we will not to speak she must not more be of our council but be simply guarded by us
he wiped his forehead which had broken out in profuse perspiration at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured
i knew that it would be some sort of comfort to him if i told him that i also had come to the same conclusion for at any rate it would take away the pain of doubt
i told him and the effect was as i expected
it is now close to the time of our general gathering
van helsing has gone away to prepare for the meeting and his painful part of it
i really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone
at the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was experienced by both van helsing and myself
harker had sent a message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present as she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements without her presence to embarrass us
the professor and i looked at each other for an instant and somehow we both seemed relieved
for my own part i thought that if mr
harker realised the danger herself it was much pain as well as much danger averted
under the circumstances we agreed by a questioning look and answer with finger on lip to preserve silence in our suspicions until we should have been able to confer alone again
we went at once into our plan of campaign
van helsing roughly put the facts before us first the czarina catherine left the thames yesterday morning
it will take her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to reach varna but we can travel overland to the same place in three days
now if we allow for two days less for the ships voyage owing to such weather influences as we know that the count can bring to bear and if we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us then we have a margin of nearly two weeks
thus in order to be quite safe we must leave here on 17th at latest
then we shall at any rate be in varna a day before the ship arrives and able to make such preparations as may be necessary
of course we shall all go armedarmed against evil things spiritual as well as physical
here quincey morris added i understand that the count comes from a wolf country and it may be that he shall get there before us
i propose that we add winchesters to our armament
i have a kind of belief in a winchester when there is any trouble of that sort around
do you remember art when we had the pack after us at tobolsk
what wouldnt we have given then for a repeater apiece
said van helsing winchesters it shall be
quinceys head is level at all times but most so when there is to hunt metaphor be more dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man
in the meantime we can do nothing here and as i think that varna is not familiar to any of us why not go there more soon
it is as long to wait here as there
tonight and tomorrow we can get ready and then if all be well we four can set out on our journey
we four
said harker interrogatively looking from one to another of us
of course
answered the professor quickly you must remain to take care of your so sweet wife
harker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow voice let us talk of that part of it in the morning
i want to consult with mina
i thought that now was the time for van helsing to warn him not to disclose our plans to her but he took no notice
i looked at him significantly and coughed
for answer he put his finger on his lips and turned away
5 october afternoon
for some time after our meeting this morning i could not think
the new phases of things leave my mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought
minas determination not to take any part in the discussion set me thinking and as i could not argue the matter with her i could only guess
i am as far as ever from a solution now
the way the others received it too puzzled me the last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us
mina is sleeping now calmly and sweetly like a little child
her lips are curved and her face beams with happiness
thank god there are such moments still for her
how strange it all is
i sat watching minas happy sleep and came as near to being happy myself as i suppose i shall ever be
as the evening drew on and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking lower the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me
all at once mina opened her eyes and looking at me tenderly said jonathan i want you to promise me something on your word of honour
a promise made to me but made holily in gods hearing and not to be broken though i should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter tears
quick you must make it to me at once
mina i said a promise like that i cannot make at once
i may have no right to make it
but dear one she said with such spiritual intensity that her eyes were like pole stars it is i who wish it and it is not for myself
you can ask dr van helsing if i am not right if he disagrees you may do as you will
nay more if you all agree later you are absolved from the promise
i promise
i said and for a moment she looked supremely happy though to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead
she said promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for the campaign against the count
not by word or inference or implication not at any time whilst this remains to me
and she solemnly pointed to the scar
i saw that she was in earnest and said solemnly i promise
and as i said it i felt that from that instant a door had been shut between us
later midnight
mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening
so much so that all the rest seemed to take courage as if infected somewhat with her gaiety as a result even i myself felt as if the pall of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted
we all retired early
mina is now sleeping like a little child it is a wonderful thing that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible trouble
thank god for it for then at least she can forget her care
perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did tonight
i shall try it
for a dreamless sleep
6 october morning
another surprise
mina woke me early about the same time as yesterday and asked me to bring dr van helsing
i thought that it was another occasion for hypnotism and without question went for the professor
he had evidently expected some such call for i found him dressed in his room
his door was ajar so that he could hear the opening of the door of our room
he came at once as he passed into the room he asked mina if the others might come too
no she said quite simply it will not be necessary
you can tell them just as well
i must go with you on your journey
dr van helsing was as startled as i was
after a moments pause he asked but why
you must take me with you
i am safer with you and you shall be safer too
but why dear madam mina
you know that your safety is our solemnest duty
we go into danger to which you are or may be more liable than any of us fromfrom circumstancesthings that have been
he paused embarrassed
as she replied she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead i know
that is why i must go
i can tell you now whilst the sun is coming up i may not be able again
i know that when the count wills me i must go
i know that if he tells me to come in secret i must come by wile by any device to hoodwinkeven jonathan
god saw the look that she turned on me as she spoke and if there be indeed a recording angel that look is noted to her everlasting honour
i could only clasp her hand
i could not speak my emotion was too great for even the relief of tears
she went on you men are brave and strong
you are strong in your numbers for you can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had to guard alone
besides i may be of service since you can hypnotise me and so learn that which even i myself do not know
dr van helsing said very gravely madam mina you are as always most wise
you shall with us come and together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve
when he had spoken minas long spell of silence made me look at her
she had fallen back on her pillow asleep she did not even wake when i had pulled up the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room
van helsing motioned to me to come with him quietly
we went to his room and within a minute lord godalming dr seward and mr morris were with us also
he told them what mina had said and went on in the morning we shall leave for varna
we have now to deal with a new factor madam mina
oh but her soul is true
it is to her an agony to tell us so much as she has done but it is most right and we are warned in time
there must be no chance lost and in varna we must be ready to act the instant when that ship arrives
what shall we do exactly
asked mr morris laconically
the professor paused before replying we shall at the first board that ship then when we have identified the box we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it
this we shall fasten for when it is there none can emerge so at least says the superstition
and to superstition must we trust at the first it was mans faith in the early and it have its root in faith still
then when we get the opportunity that we seek when none are near to see we shall open the box andand all will be well
i shall not wait for any opportunity said morris
when i see the box i shall open it and destroy the monster though there were a thousand men looking on and if i am to be wiped out for it the next moment
i grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel
i think he understood my look i hope he did
good boy said dr van helsing
brave boy
quincey is all man
god bless him for it
my child believe me none of us shall lag behind or pause from any fear
i do but say what we may dowhat we must do
but indeed indeed we cannot say what we shall do
there are so many things which may happen and their ways and their ends are so various that until the moment we may not say
we shall all be armed in all ways and when the time for the end has come our effort shall not be lack
now let us today put all our affairs in order
let all things which touch on others dear to us and who on us depend be complete for none of us can tell what or when or how the end may be
as for me my own affairs are regulate and as i have nothing else to do i shall go make arrangements for the travel
i shall have all tickets and so forth for our journey
there was nothing further to be said and we parted
i shall now settle up all my affairs of earth and be ready for whatever may come
it is all done my will is made and all complete
mina if she survive is my sole heir
if it should not be so then the others who have been so good to us shall have remainder
it is now drawing towards the sunset minas uneasiness calls my attention to it
i am sure that there is something on her mind which the time of exact sunset will reveal
these occasions are becoming harrowing times for us all for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new dangersome new pain which however may in gods will be means to a good end
i write all these things in the diary since my darling must not hear them now but if it may be that she can see them again they shall be ready
she is calling to me
jonathan harker has asked me to note this as he says he is hardly equal to the task and he wants an exact record kept
i think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see mr
harker a little before the time of sunset
we have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her or inciting her to action
this mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset and lasts till either the sun is high or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon
at first there is a sort of negative condition as if some tie were loosened and then the absolute freedom quickly follows when however the freedom ceases the changeback or relapse comes quickly preceded only by a spell of warning silence
tonight when we met she was somewhat constrained and bore all the signs of an internal struggle
i put it down myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so
a very few minutes however gave her complete control of herself then motioning her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining she made the rest of us bring chairs up close
taking her husbands hand in hers began we are all here together in freedom for perhaps the last time
i know dear i know that you will always be with me to the end
this was to her husband whose hand had as we could see tightened upon hers
in the morning we go out upon our task and god alone knows what may be in store for any of us
you are going to be so good to me as to take me with you
i know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak woman whose soul perhaps is lostno no not yet but is at any rate at stakeyou will do
but you must remember that i am not as you are
there is a poison in my blood in my soul which may destroy me which must destroy me unless some relief comes to us
oh my friends you know as well as i do that my soul is at stake and though i know there is one way out for me you must not and i must not take it
she looked appealingly to us all in turn beginning and ending with her husband
what is that way
asked van helsing in a hoarse voice
what is that way which we must notmay nottake
that i may die now either by my own hand or that of another before the greater evil is entirely wrought
i know and you know that were i once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit even as you did my poor lucys
were death or the fear of death the only thing that stood in the way i would not shrink to die here now amidst the friends who love me
but death is not all
i cannot believe that to die in such a case when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be done is gods will
therefore i on my part give up here the certainty of eternal rest and go out into the dark where may be the blackest things that the world or the nether world holds
we were all silent for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude
the faces of the others were set and harkers grew ashen grey perhaps he guessed better than any of us what was coming
she continued this is what i can give into the hotchpot
i could not but note the quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place and with all seriousness
what will each of you give
your lives i know she went on quickly that is easy for brave men
your lives are gods and you can give them back to him but what will you give to me
she looked again questioningly but this time avoided her husbands face
quincey seemed to understand he nodded and her face lit up
then i shall tell you plainly what i want for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection between us now
you must promise me one and alleven you my beloved husbandthat should the time come you will kill me
what is that time
the voice was quinceys but it was low and strained
when you shall be convinced that i am so changed that it is better that i die than i may live
when i am thus dead in the flesh then you will without a moments delay drive a stake through me and cut off my head or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest
quincey was the first to rise after the pause
he knelt down before her and taking her hand in his said solemnly im only a rough fellow who hasnt perhaps lived as a man should to win such a distinction but i swear to you by all that i hold sacred and dear that should the time ever come i shall not flinch from the duty that you have set us
and i promise you too that i shall make all certain for if i am only doubtful i shall take it that the time has come
my true friend
was all she could say amid her fastfalling tears as bending over she kissed his hand
i swear the same my dear madam mina
and i
said lord godalming each of them in turn kneeling to her to take the oath
i followed myself
then her husband turned to her waneyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of his hair and asked and must i too make such a promise oh my wife
you too my dearest she said with infinite yearning of pity in her voice and eyes
you must not shrink
you are nearest and dearest and all the world to me our souls are knit into one for all life and all time
think dear that there have been times when brave men have killed their wives and their womenkind to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy
their hands did not falter any the more because those that they loved implored them to slay them
it is mens duty towards those whom they love in such times of sore trial
and oh my dear if it is to be that i must meet death at any hand let it be at the hand of him that loves me best
dr van helsing i have not forgotten your mercy in poor lucys case to him who lovedshe stopped with a flying blush and changed her phraseto him who had best right to give her peace
if that time shall come again i look to you to make it a happy memory of my husbands life that it was his loving hand which set me free from the awful thrall upon me
again i swear
came the professors resonant voice
harker smiled positively smiled as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and said and now one word of warning a warning which you must never forget this time if it ever come may come quickly and unexpectedly and in such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity
at such a time i myself might benay
if the time ever comes shall be leagued with your enemy against you
one more request she became very solemn as she said this it is not vital and necessary like the other but i want you to do one thing for me if you will
we all acquiesced but no one spoke there was no need to speak i want you to read the burial service
she was interrupted by a deep groan from her husband taking his hand in hers she held it over her heart and continued you must read it over me some day
whatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of things it will be a sweet thought to all or some of us
you my dearest will i hope read it for then it will be in your voice in my memory for evercome what may
but oh my dear one he pleaded death is afar off from you
nay she said holding up a warning hand
i am deeper in death at this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me
oh my wife must i read it
he said before he began
it would comfort me my husband
was all she said and he began to read when she had got the book ready
how can ihow could any onetell of that strange scene its solemnity its gloom its sadness its horror and withal its sweetness
even a sceptic who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional would have been melted to the heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady or heard the tender passion of her husbands voice as in tones so broken with emotion that often he had to pause he read the simple and beautiful service from the burial of the dead
ii cannot go onwordsandvvoiceffail mme
she was right in her instinct
strange as it all was bizarre as it may hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time it comforted us much and the silence which showed mr
harkers coming relapse from her freedom of soul did not seem so full of despair to any of us as we had dreaded
15 october varna
we left charing cross on the morning of the 12th got to paris the same night and took the places secured for us in the orient express
we travelled night and day arriving here at about five oclock
lord godalming went to the consulate to see if any telegram had arrived for him whilst the rest of us came on to this hotelthe odessus
the journey may have had incidents i was however too eager to get on to care for them
until the czarina catherine comes into port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world
mina is well and looks to be getting stronger her colour is coming back
she sleeps a great deal throughout the journey she slept nearly all the time
before sunrise and sunset however she is very wakeful and alert and it has become a habit for van helsing to hypnotise her at such times
at first some effort was needed and he had to make many passes but now she seems to yield at once as if by habit and scarcely any action is needed
he seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will and her thoughts obey him
he always asks her what she can see and hear
she answers to the first nothing all is dark
and to the second i can hear the waves lapping against the ship and the water rushing by
canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak
the wind is highi can hear it in the shrouds and the bow throws back the foam
it is evident that the czarina catherine is still at sea hastening on her way to varna
lord godalming has just returned
he had four telegrams one each day since we started and all to the same effect that the czarina catherine had not been reported to lloyds from anywhere
he had arranged before leaving london that his agent should send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported
he was to have a message even if she were not reported so that he might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire
we had dinner and went to bed early
tomorrow we are to see the viceconsul and to arrange if we can about getting on board the ship as soon as she arrives
van helsing says that our chance will be to get on the boat between sunrise and sunset
the count even if he takes the form of a bat cannot cross the running water of his own volition and so cannot leave the ship
as he dare not change to mans form without suspicionwhich he evidently wishes to avoidhe must remain in the box
if then we can come on board after sunrise he is at our mercy for we can open the box and make sure of him as we did of poor lucy before he wakes
what mercy he shall get from us will not count for much
we think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the seamen
this is the country where bribery can do anything and we are well supplied with money
we have only to make sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being warned and we shall be safe
judge moneybag will settle this case i think
16 october
minas report still the same lapping waves and rushing water darkness and favouring winds
we are evidently in good time and when we hear of the czarina catherine we shall be ready
as she must pass the dardanelles we are sure to have some report
17 october
everything is pretty well fixed now i think to welcome the count on his return from his tour
godalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from a friend of his and got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk
the owner gave him a paper telling the captain to give him every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship and also a similar authorisation to his agent at varna
we have seen the agent who was much impressed with godalmings kindly manner to him and we are all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done
we have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open
if the count is there van helsing and seward will cut off his head at once and drive a stake through his heart
morris and godalming and i shall prevent interference even if we have to use the arms which we shall have ready
the professor says that if we can so treat the counts body it will soon after fall into dust
in such case there would be no evidence against us in case any suspicion of murder were aroused
but even if it were not we should stand or fall by our act and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and a rope
for myself i should take the chance only too thankfully if it were to come
we mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our intent
we have arranged with certain officials that the instant the czarina catherine is seen we are to be informed by a special messenger
24 october
a whole week of waiting
daily telegrams to godalming but only the same story not yet reported
minas morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried lapping waves rushing water and creaking masts
telegram october 24th
rufus smith lloyds london to lord godalming care of h
b
viceconsul varna
czarina catherine reported this morning from dardanelles
25 october
how i miss my phonograph
to write diary with a pen is irksome to me but van helsing says i must
we were all wild with excitement yesterday when godalming got his telegram from lloyds
i know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard
harker alone of our party did not show any signs of emotion
after all it is not strange that she did not for we took special care not to let her know anything about it and we all tried not to show any excitement when we were in her presence
in old days she would i am sure have noticed no matter how we might have tried to conceal it but in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks
the lethargy grows upon her and though she seems strong and well and is getting back some of her colour van helsing and i are not satisfied
we talk of her often we have not however said a word to the others
it would break poor harkers heartcertainly his nerveif he knew that we had even a suspicion on the subject
van helsing examines he tells me her teeth very carefully whilst she is in the hypnotic condition for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a change in her
if this change should come it would be necessary to take steps
we both know what those steps would have to be though we do not mention our thoughts to each other
we should neither of us shrink from the taskawful though it be to contemplate
euthanasia is an excellent and a comforting word
i am grateful to whoever invented it
it is only about 24 hours sail from the dardanelles to here at the rate the czarina catherine has come from london
she should therefore arrive some time in the morning but as she cannot possibly get in before then we are all about to retire early
we shall get up at one oclock so as to be ready
25 october noon
no news yet of the ships arrival
harkers hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual so it is possible that we may get news at any moment
we men are all in a fever of excitement except harker who is calm his hands are cold as ice and an hour ago i found him whetting the edge of the great ghoorka knife which he now always carries with him
it will be a bad lookout for the count if the edge of that kukri ever touches his throat driven by that stern icecold hand
van helsing and i were a little alarmed about mr
harker today
about noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like although we kept silence to the others we were neither of us happy about it
she had been restless all the morning so that we were at first glad to know that she was sleeping
when however her husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her we went to her room to see for ourselves
she was breathing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else
poor girl she has so much to forget that it is no wonder that sleep if it brings oblivion to her does her good
our opinion was justified for when after a refreshing sleep of some hours she woke up she seemed brighter and better than she had been for days
at sunset she made the usual hypnotic report
wherever he may be in the black sea the count is hurrying to his destination
to his doom i trust
26 october
another day and no tidings of the czarina catherine
she ought to be here by now
that she is still journeying somewhere is apparent for mr
harkers hypnotic report at sunrise was still the same
it is possible that the vessel may be lying by at times for fog some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port
we must continue our watching as the ship may now be signalled any moment
27 october noon
most strange no news yet of the ship we wait for
harker reported last night and this morning as usual lapping waves and rushing water though she added that the waves were very faint
the telegrams from london have been the same no further report
van helsing is terribly anxious and told me just now that he fears the count is escaping us
he added significantly i did not like that lethargy of madam minas
souls and memories can do strange things during trance
i was about to ask him more but harker just then came in and he held up a warning hand
we must try tonight at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state
28 october
telegram
rufus smith london to lord godalming care h
vice consul varna
czarina catherine reported entering galatz at one oclock today
when the telegram came announcing the arrival in galatz i do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been expected
true we did not know whence or how or when the bolt would come but i think we all expected that something strange would happen
the delay of arrival at varna made us individually satisfied that things would not be just as we had expected we only waited to learn where the change would occur
none the less however was it a surprise
i suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be not as we should know that they will be
transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels even if it be a willothewisp to man
it was an odd experience and we all took it differently
van helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment as though in remonstrance with the almighty but he said not a word and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set
lord godalming grew very pale and sat breathing heavily
i was myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another
quincey morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which i knew so well in our old wandering days it meant action
harker grew ghastly white so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn but she folded her hands meekly and looked up in prayer
harker smiledactually smiledthe dark bitter smile of one who is without hope but at the same time his action belied his words for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great kukri knife and rested there
when does the next train start for galatz
said van helsing to us generally
at 630 tomorrow morning
we all started for the answer came from mr
how on earth do you know
said art
you forgetor perhaps you do not know though jonathan does and so does dr van helsingthat i am the train fiend
at home in exeter i always used to make up the timetables so as to be helpful to my husband
i found it so useful sometimes that i always make a study of the timetables now
i knew that if anything were to take us to castle dracula we should go by galatz or at any rate through bucharest so i learned the times very carefully
unhappily there are not many to learn as the only train tomorrow leaves as i say
wonderful woman
murmured the professor
cant we get a special
van helsing shook his head i fear not
this land is very different from yours or mine even if we did have a special it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular train
moreover we have something to prepare
we must think
now let us organize
you friend arthur go to the train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning
do you friend jonathan go to the agent of the ship and get from him letters to the agent in galatz with authority to make search the ship just as it was here
morris quincey you see the viceconsul and get his aid with his fellow in galatz and all he can do to make our way smooth so that no times be lost when over the danube
john will stay with madam mina and me and we shall consult
for so if time be long you may be delayed and it will not matter when the sun set since i am here with madam to make report
and i said mr
harker brightly and more like her old self than she had been for many a long day shall try to be of use in all ways and shall think and write for you as i used to do
something is shifting from me in some strange way and i feel freer than i have been of late
the three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to realise the significance of her words but van helsing and i turning to each other met each a grave and troubled glance
we said nothing at the time however
when the three men had gone out to their tasks van helsing asked mr
harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of harkers journal at the castle
she went away to get it when the door was shut upon her he said to me we mean the same
speak out
there is some change
it is a hope that makes me sick for it may deceive us
do you know why i asked her to get the manuscript
said i unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone
you are in part right friend john but only in part
i want to tell you something
and oh my friend i am taking a greata terriblerisk but i believe it is right
in the moment when madam mina said those words that arrest both our understanding an inspiration came to me
in the trance of three days ago the count sent her his spirit to read her mind or more like he took her to see him in his earthbox in the ship with water rushing just as it go free at rise and set of sun
he learn then that we are here for she have more to tell in her open life with eyes to see and ears to hear than he shut as he is in his coffinbox
now he make his most effort to escape us
at present he want her not
he is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call but he cut her offtake her as he can do out of his own power that so she come not to him
there i have hope that our manbrains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of god will come higher than his childbrain that lie in his tomb for centuries that grow not yet to our stature and that do only work selfish and therefore small
here comes madam mina not a word to her of her trance
she know it not and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when we want all her hope all her courage when most we want all her great brain which is trained like mans brain but is of sweet woman and have a special power which the count give her and which he may not take away altogetherthough he think not so
let me speak and you shall learn
oh john my friend we are in awful straits
i fear as i never feared before
we can only trust the good god
silence
i thought that the professor was going to break down and have hysterics just as he had when lucy died but with a great effort he controlled himself and was at perfect nervous poise when mr
harker tripped into the room bright and happylooking and in the doing of work seemingly forgetful of her misery
as she came in she handed a number of sheets of typewriting to van helsing
he looked over them gravely his face brightening up as he read
then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said friend john to you with so much of experience alreadyand you too dear madam mina that are younghere is a lesson do not fear ever to think
a halfthought has been buzzing often in my brain but i fear to let him loose his wings
here now with more knowledge i go back to where that halfthought come from and i find that he be no halfthought at all that be a whole thought though so young that he is not yet strong to use his little wings
nay like the ugly duck of my friend hans andersen he be no duckthought at all but a big swanthought that sail nobly on big wings when the time come for him to try them
see i read here what jonathan have written that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into turkey land who when he was beaten back came again and again and again though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph
what does this tell us
not much
the counts childthought see nothing therefore he speak so free
your manthought see nothing my manthought see nothing till just now
but there comes another word from some one who speak without thought because she too know not what it meanwhat it might mean
just as there are elements which rest yet when in natures course they move on their way and they touchthen pouf
and there comes a flash of light heaven wide that blind and kill and destroy some but that show up all earth below for leagues and leagues
well i shall explain
to begin have you ever study the philosophy of crime
yes and no
you john yes for it is a study of insanity
you no madam mina for crime touch you notnot but once
still your mind works true and argues not a particulari ad universale
there is this peculiarity in criminals
it is so constant in all countries and at all times that even police who know not much from philosophy come to know it empirically that it is
that is to be empiric
the criminal always work at one crimethat is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime and who will of none other
this criminal has not full manbrain
he is clever and cunning and resourceful but he be not of manstature as to brain
he be of childbrain in much
now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime also he too have childbrain and it is of the child to do what he have done
the little bird the little fish the little animal learn not by principle but empirically and when he learn to do then there is to him the ground to start from to do more
 dos pou sto said archimedes
give me a fulcrum and i shall move the world
to do once is the fulcrum whereby childbrain become manbrain and until he have the purpose to do more he continue to do the same again every time just as he have done before
oh my dear i see that your eyes are opened and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues for mr
harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled
he went on now you shall speak
tell us two dry men of science what you see with those so bright eyes
he took her hand and held it whilst she spoke
his finger and thumb closed on her pulse as i thought instinctively and unconsciously as she spoke the count is a criminal and of criminal type
nordau and lombroso would so classify him and qu criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind
thus in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit
his past is a clue and the one page of it that we knowand that from his own lipstells that once before when in what mr morris would call a tight place he went back to his own country from the land he had tried to invade and thence without losing purpose prepared himself for a new effort
he came again better equipped for his work and won
so he came to london to invade a new land
he was beaten and when all hope of success was lost and his existence in danger he fled back over the sea to his home just as formerly he had fled back over the danube from turkey land
good good
oh you so clever lady
said van helsing enthusiastically as he stooped and kissed her hand
a moment later he said to me as calmly as though we had been having a sickroom consultation seventytwo only and in all this excitement
i have hope
turning to her again he said with keen expectation but go on
go on
there is more to tell if you will
be not afraid john and i know
i do in any case and shall tell you if you are right
speak without fear
i will try to but you will forgive me if i seem egotistical
nay
fear not you must be egotist for it is of you that we think
then as he is criminal he is selfish and as his intellect is small and his action is based on selfishness he confines himself to one purpose
that purpose is remorseless
as he fled back over the danube leaving his forces to be cut to pieces so now he is intent on being safe careless of all
so his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night
i felt it
oh i felt it
thank god for his great mercy
my soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour and all that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for his ends
the professor stood up he has so used your mind and by it he has left us here in varna whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to galatz where doubtless he had made preparation for escaping from us
but his childmind only saw so far and it may be that as ever is in gods providence the very thing that the evildoer most reckoned on for his selfish good turns out to be his chiefest harm
the hunter is taken in his own snare as the great psalmist says
for now that he think he is free from every trace of us all and that he has escaped us with so many hours to him then his selfish childbrain will whisper him to sleep
he think too that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind there can be no knowledge of him to you there is where he fail
that terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him in spirit as you have as yet done in your times of freedom when the sun rise and set
at such times you go by my volition and not by his and this power to good of you and others as you have won from your suffering at his hands
this is now all the more precious that he know it not and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our where
we however are not selfish and we believe that god is with us through all this blackness and these many dark hours
we shall follow him and we shall not flinch even if we peril ourselves that we become like him
friend john this has been a great hour and it have done much to advance us on our way
you must be scribe and write him all down so that when the others return from their work you can give it to them then they shall know as we do
and so i have written it whilst we wait their return and mr
harker has written with her typewriter all since she brought the ms
to us
this is written in the train from varna to galatz
last night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset
each of us had done his work as well as he could so far as thought and endeavour and opportunity go we are prepared for the whole of our journey and for our work when we get to galatz
when the usual time came round mr
harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort and after a longer and more serious effort on the part of van helsing than has been usually necessary she sank into the trance
usually she speaks on a hint but this time the professor had to ask her questions and to ask them pretty resolutely before we could learn anything at last her answer came i can see nothing we are still there are no waves lapping but only a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser
i can hear mens voices calling near and far and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks
a gun is fired somewhere the echo of it seems far away
there is tramping of feet overhead and ropes and chains are dragged along
what is this
there is a gleam of light i can feel the air blowing upon me
here she stopped
she had risen as if impulsively from where she lay on the sofa and raised both her hands palms upwards as if lifting a weight
van helsing and i looked at each other with understanding
quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently whilst harkers hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his kukri
there was a long pause
we all knew that the time when she could speak was passing but we felt that it was useless to say anything
suddenly she sat up and as she opened her eyes said sweetly would none of you like a cup of tea
you must all be so tired
we could only make her happy and so acquiesced
she bustled off to get tea when she had gone van helsing said you see my friends
he is close to land he has left his earthchest
but he has yet to get on shore
in the night he may lie hidden somewhere but if he be not carried on shore or if the ship do not touch it he cannot achieve the land
in such case he can if it be in the night change his form and can jump or fly on shore as he did at whitby
but if the day come before he get on shore then unless he be carried he cannot escape
and if he be carried then the customs men may discover what the box contain
thus in fine if he escape not on shore tonight or before dawn there will be the whole day lost to him
we may then arrive in time for if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime boxed up and at our mercy for he dare not be his true self awake and visible lest he be discovered
there was no more to be said so we waited in patience until the dawn at which time we might learn more from mr
early this morning we listened with breathless anxiety for her response in her trance
the hypnotic stage was even longer in coming than before and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was so short that we began to despair
van helsing seemed to throw his whole soul into the effort at last in obedience to his will she made reply all is dark
i hear lapping water level with me and some creaking as of wood on wood
she paused and the red sun shot up
we must wait till tonight
and so it is that we are travelling towards galatz in an agony of expectation
we are due to arrive between two and three in the morning but already at bucharest we are three hours late so we cannot possibly get in till well after sunup
thus we shall have two more hypnotic messages from mr
harker either or both may possibly throw more light on what is happening
sunset has come and gone
fortunately it came at a time when there was no distraction for had it occurred whilst we were at a station we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation
harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than this morning
i am in fear that her power of reading the counts sensations may die away just when we want it most
it seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work
whilst she has been in the trance hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts
if this goes on it may ultimately mislead us
if i thought that the counts power over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be a happy thought but i am afraid that it may not be so
when she did speak her words were enigmatical something is going out i can feel it pass me like a cold wind
i can hear far off confused soundsas of men talking in strange tongues fiercefalling water and the howling of wolves
she stopped and a shudder ran through her increasing in intensity for a few seconds till at the end she shook as though in a palsy
she said no more even in answer to the professors imperative questioning
when she woke from the trance she was cold and exhausted and languid but her mind was all alert
she could not remember anything but asked what she had said when she was told she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in silence
30 october 7 am we are near galatz now and i may not have time to write later
sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all
knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance van helsing began his passes earlier than usual
they produced no effect however until the regular time when she yielded with a still greater difficulty only a minute before the sun rose
the professor lost no time in his questioning her answer came with equal quickness all is dark
i hear water swirling by level with my ears and the creaking of wood on wood
cattle low far off
there is another sound a queer one like she stopped and grew white and whiter still
go on go on
speak i command you
said van helsing in an agonised voice
at the same time there was despair in his eyes for the risen sun was reddening even mr
harkers pale face
she opened her eyes and we all started as she said sweetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern oh professor why ask me to do what you know i cant
i dont remember anything
then seeing the look of amazement on our faces she said turning from one to the other with a troubled look what have i said
i know nothing only that i was lying here half asleep and heard you say go on
it seemed so funny to hear you order me about as if i were a bad child
oh madam mina he said sadly it is proof if proof be needed of how i love and honour you when a word for your good spoken more earnest than ever can seem so strange because it is to order her whom i am proud to obey
the whistles are sounding we are nearing galatz
we are on fire with anxiety and eagerness
30 october
mr morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been ordered by telegraph he being the one who could best be spared since he does not speak any foreign language
the forces were distributed much as they had been at varna except that lord godalming went to the viceconsul as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some sort to the official we being in extreme hurry
jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival of the czarina catherine
lord godalming has returned
the consul is away and the viceconsul sick so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk
he was very obliging and offered to do anything in his power
at nine oclock dr van helsing dr seward and i called on messrs
mackenzie & steinkoff the agents of the london firm of hapgood
they had received a wire from london in answer to lord godalmings telegraphed request asking us to show them any civility in their power
they were more than kind and courteous and took us at once on board the czarina catherine which lay at anchor out in the river harbour
there we saw the captain donelson by name who told us of his voyage
he said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a run
man
he said but it made us afeard for we expeckit that we should have to pay for it wi some rare piece o ill luck so as to keep up the average
its no canny to run frae london to the black sea wi a wind ahint ye as though the deil himself were blawin on yer sail for his ain purpose
an a the time we could no speer a thing
gin we were nigh a ship or a port or a headland a fog fell on us and travelled wi us till when after it had lifted and we looked out the deil a thing could we see
we ran by gibraltar wioot bein able to signal an till we came to the dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass we never were within hail o aught
at first i inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted but whiles i thocht that if the deil was minded to get us into the black sea quick he was like to do it whether we would or no
if we had a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi the owners or no hurt to our traffic an the old mon who had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin him
this mixture of simplicity and cunning of superstition and commercial reasoning aroused van helsing who said mine friend that devil is more clever than he is thought by some and he know when he meet his match
the skipper was not displeased with the compliment and went on when we got past the bosphorus the men began to grumble some o them the roumanians came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin old man just before we had started frae london
i had seen them speer at the fellow and put out their twa fingers when they saw him to guard against the evil eye
but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous
i sent them aboot their business pretty quick but as just after a fog closed in on us i felt a wee bit as they did anent something though i wouldnt say it was agin the big box
well on we went and as the fog didnt let up for five days i joost let the wind carry us for if the deil wanted to get somewhereswell he would fetch it up areet
an if he didnt well wed keep a sharp lookout anyhow
sure eneuch we had a fair way and deep water all the time and two days ago when the mornin sun came through the fog we found ourselves just in the river opposite galatz
the roumanians were wild and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and fling it in the river
i had to argy wi them aboot it wi a handspike an when the last o them rose off the deck wi his head in his hand i had convinced them that evil eye or no evil eye the property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river danube
they had mind ye taken the box on the deck ready to fling in and as it was marked galatz via varna i thocht id let it lie till we discharged in the port an get rid ot althegither
we didnt do much clearin that day an had to remain the nicht at anchor but in the mornin braw an airly an hour before sunup a man came aboard wi an order written to him from england to receive a box marked for one count dracula
sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his hand
he had his papers a reet an glad i was to be rid o the dam thing for i was beginnin masel to feel uneasy at it
if the deil did have any luggage aboord the ship im thinkin it was nane ither than that same
what was the name of the man who took it
asked dr van helsing with restrained eagerness
ill be tellin ye quick
he answered and stepping down to his cabin produced a receipt signed immanuel hildesheim
burgenstrasse 16 was the address
we found out that this was all the captain knew so with thanks we came away
we found hildesheim in his office a hebrew of rather the adelphi theatre type with a nose like a sheep and a fez
his arguments were pointed with speciewe doing the punctuationand with a little bargaining he told us what he knew
this turned out to be simple but important
he had received a letter from mr de ville of london telling him to receive if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs a box which would arrive at galatz in the czarina catherine
this he was to give in charge to a certain petrof skinsky who dealt with the slovaks who traded down the river to the port
he had been paid for his work by an english bank note which had been duly cashed for gold at the danube international bank
when skinsky had come to him he had taken him to the ship and handed over the box so as to save porterage
that was all he knew
we then sought for skinsky but were unable to find him
one of his neighbours who did not seem to bear him any affection said that he had gone away two days before no one knew whither
this was corroborated by his landlord who had received by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due in english money
this had been between ten and eleven oclock last night
we were at a standstill again
whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that the body of skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of st
peter and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal
those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror the women crying out this is the work of a slovak
we hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair and so detained
as we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion
we were all convinced that the box was on its way by water to somewhere but where that might be we would have to discover
with heavy hearts we came home to the hotel to mina
when we met together the first thing was to consult as to taking mina again into our confidence
things are getting desperate and it is at least a chance though a hazardous one
as a preliminary step i was released from my promise to her
30 october evening
they were so tired and worn out and dispirited that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest so i asked them all to lie down for half an hour whilst i should enter everything up to the moment
i feel so grateful to the man who invented the travellers typewriter and to mr morris for getting this one for me
i should have felt quite astray doing the work if i had to write with a pen
it is all done poor dear dear jonathan what he must have suffered what must he be suffering now
he lies on the sofa hardly seeming to breathe and his whole body appears in collapse
his brows are knit his face is drawn with pain
poor fellow maybe he is thinking and i can see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts
if i could only help at all
i shall do what i can
i have asked dr van helsing and he has got me all the papers that i have not yet seen
whilst they are resting i shall go over all carefully and perhaps i may arrive at some conclusion
i shall try to follow the professors example and think without prejudice on the facts before me
i do believe that under gods providence i have made a discovery
i shall get the maps and look over them
i am more than ever sure that i am right
my new conclusion is ready so i shall get our party together and read it
they can judge it it is well to be accurate and every minute is precious
mina harkers memorandum
entered in her journal
ground of inquiry
count draculas problem is to get back to his own place
a he must be brought back by some one
this is evident for had he power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man or wolf or bat or in some other way
he evidently fears discovery or interference in the state of helplessness in which he must beconfined as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box
b how is he to be taken
here a process of exclusions may help us
by road by rail by water
1
by road
there are endless difficulties especially in leaving the city
x there are people and people are curious and investigate
a hint a surmise a doubt as to what might be in the box would destroy him
y there are or there may be customs and octroi officers to pass
z his pursuers might follow
this is his highest fear and in order to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled so far as he can even his victimme
2
by rail
there is no one in charge of the box
it would have to take its chance of being delayed and delay would be fatal with enemies on the track
true he might escape at night but what would he be if left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to
this is not what he intends and he does not mean to risk it
3
by water
here is the safest way in one respect but with most danger in another
on the water he is powerless except at night even then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves
but were he wrecked the living water would engulf him helpless and he would indeed be lost
he could have the vessel drive to land but if it were unfriendly land wherein he was not free to move his position would still be desperate
we know from the record that he was on the water so what we have to do is to ascertain what water
the first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet we may then get a light on what his later task is to be
firstly
we must differentiate between what he did in london as part of his general plan of action when he was pressed for moments and had to arrange as best he could
secondly we must see as well as we can surmise it from the facts we know of what he has done here
as to the first he evidently intended to arrive at galatz and sent invoice to varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of exit from england his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape
the proof of this is the letter of instructions sent to immanuel hildesheim to clear and take away the box before sunrise
there is also the instruction to petrof skinsky
these we must only guess at but there must have been some letter or message since skinsky came to hildesheim
that so far his plans were successful we know
the czarina catherine made a phenomenally quick journeyso much so that captain donelsons suspicions were aroused but his superstition united with his canniness played the counts game for him and he ran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at galatz
that the counts arrangements were well made has been proved
hildesheim cleared the box took it off and gave it to skinsky
skinsky took itand here we lose the trail
we only know that the box is somewhere on the water moving along
the customs and the octroi if there be any have been avoided
now we come to what the count must have done after his arrival on land at galatz
the box was given to skinsky before sunrise
at sunrise the count could appear in his own form
here we ask why skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work
in my husbands diary skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the slovaks who trade down the river to the port and the mans remark that the murder was the work of a slovak showed the general feeling against his class
the count wanted isolation
my surmise is this that in london the count decided to get back to his castle by water as the most safe and secret way
he was brought from the castle by szgany and probably they delivered their cargo to slovaks who took the boxes to varna for there they were shipped for london
thus the count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service
when the box was on land before sunrise or after sunset he came out from his box met skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river
when this was done and he knew that all was in train he blotted out his traces as he thought by murdering his agent
i have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the slovaks to have ascended is either the pruth or the sereth
i read in the typescript that in my trance i heard cows low and water swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood
the count in his box then was on a river in an open boatpropelled probably either by oars or poles for the banks are near and it is working against stream
there would be no such sound if floating down stream
of course it may not be either the sereth or the pruth but we may possibly investigate further
now of these two the pruth is the more easily navigated but the sereth is at fundu joined by the bistritza which runs up round the borgo pass
the loop it makes is manifestly as close to draculas castle as can be got by water
mina harkers journalcontinued
when i had done reading jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me
the others kept shaking me by both hands and dr van helsing said our dear madam mina is once more our teacher
her eyes have been where we were blinded
now we are on the track once again and this time we may succeed
our enemy is at his most helpless and if we can come on him by day on the water our task will be over
he has a start but he is powerless to hasten as he may not leave his box lest those who carry him may suspect for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where he perish
this he knows and will not
now men to our council of war for here and now we must plan what each and all shall do
i shall get a steam launch and follow him said lord godalming
and i horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land said mr morris
said the professor both good
but neither must go alone
there must be force to overcome force if need be the slovak is strong and rough and he carries rude arms
all the men smiled for amongst them they carried a small arsenal
said mr morris i have brought some winchesters they are pretty handy in a crowd and there may be wolves
the count if you remember took some other precautions he made some requisitions on others that mr
harker could not quite hear or understand
we must be ready at all points
dr seward said i think i had better go with quincey
we have been accustomed to hunt together and we two well armed will be a match for whatever may come along
you must not be alone art
it may be necessary to fight the slovaks and a chance thrustfor i dont suppose these fellows carry gunswould undo all our plans
there must be no chances this time we shall not rest until the counts head and body have been separated and we are sure that he cannot reincarnate
he looked at jonathan as he spoke and jonathan looked at me
i could see that the poor dear was torn about in his mind
of course he wanted to be with me but then the boat service would most likely be the one which would destroy the
the
vampire
why did i hesitate to write the word
he was silent awhile and during his silence dr van helsing spoke friend jonathan this is to you for twice reasons
first because you are young and brave and can fight and all energies may be needed at the last and again that it is your right to destroy himthatwhich has wrought such woe to you and yours
be not afraid for madam mina she will be my care if i may
i am old
my legs are not so quick to run as once and i am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be or to fight with lethal weapons
but i can be of other service i can fight in other way
and i can die if need be as well as younger men
now let me say that what i would is this while you my lord godalming and friend jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river and whilst john and quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be landed i will take madam mina right into the heart of the enemys country
whilst the old fox is tied in his box floating on the running stream whence he cannot escape to landwhere he dares not raise the lid of his coffinbox lest his slovak carriers should in fear leave him to perishwe shall go in the track where jonathan wentfrom bistritz over the borgo and find our way to the castle of dracula
here madam minas hypnotic power will surely help and we shall find our wayall dark and unknown otherwiseafter the first sunrise when we are near that fateful place
there is much to be done and other places to be made sanctify so that that nest of vipers be obliterated
here jonathan interrupted him hotly do you mean to say professor van helsing that you would bring mina in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devils illness right into the jaws of his deathtrap
not for the world
not for heaven or hell
he became almost speechless for a minute and then went on do you know what the place is
have you seen that awful den of hellish infamywith the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes and every speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo
have you felt the vampires lips upon your throat
here he turned to me and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry oh my god what have we done to have this terror upon us
and he sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery
the professors voice as he spoke in clear sweet tones which seemed to vibrate in the air calmed us all oh my friend it is because i would save madam mina from that awful place that i would go
god forbid that i should take her into that place
there is workwild workto be done there that her eyes may not see
we men here all save jonathan have seen with their own eyes what is to be done before that place can be purify
remember that we are in terrible straits
if the count escape us this timeand he is strong and subtle and cunninghe may choose to sleep him for a century and then in time our dear onehe took my handwould come to him to keep him company and would be as those others that you jonathan saw
you have told us of their gloating lips you heard their ribald laugh as they clutched the moving bag that the count threw to them
you shudder and well may it be
forgive me that i make you so much pain but it is necessary
my friend is it not a dire need for the which i am giving possibly my life
if it were that any one went into that place to stay it is i who would have to go to keep them company
do as you will said jonathan with a sob that shook him all over we are in the hands of god
oh it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked
how can women help loving men when they are so earnest and so true and so brave
and too it made me think of the wonderful power of money
what can it not do when it is properly applied and what might it do when basely used
i felt so thankful that lord godalming is rich and that both he and mr morris who also has plenty of money are willing to spend it so freely
for if they did not our little expedition could not start either so promptly or so well equipped as it will within another hour
it is not three hours since it was arranged what part each of us was to do and now lord godalming and jonathan have a lovely steam launch with steam up ready to start at a moments notice
dr seward and mr morris have half a dozen good horses well appointed
we have all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had
professor van helsing and i are to leave by the 1140 train tonight for veresti where we are to get a carriage to drive to the borgo pass
we are bringing a good deal of ready money as we are to buy a carriage and horses
we shall drive ourselves for we have no one whom we can trust in the matter
the professor knows something of a great many languages so we shall get on all right
we have all got arms even for me a largebore revolver jonathan would not be happy unless i was armed like the rest
i cannot carry one arm that the rest do the scar on my forehead forbids that
dear dr van helsing comforts me by telling me that i am fully armed as there may be wolves the weather is getting colder every hour and there are snowflurries which come and go as warnings
it took all my courage to say goodbye to my darling
we may never meet again
courage mina
the professor is looking at you keenly his look is a warning
there must be no tears nowunless it may be that god will let them fall in gladness
october 30
i am writing this in the light from the furnace door of the steam launch lord godalming is firing up
he is an experienced hand at the work as he has had for years a launch of his own on the thames and another on the norfolk broads
regarding our plans we finally decided that minas guess was correct and that if any waterway was chosen for the counts escape back to his castle the sereth and then the bistritza at its junction would be the one
we took it that somewhere about the 47th degree north latitude would be the place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the carpathians
we have no fear in running at good speed up the river at night there is plenty of water and the banks are wide enough apart to make steaming even in the dark easy enough
lord godalming tells me to sleep for a while as it is enough for the present for one to be on watch
but i cannot sleephow can i with the terrible danger hanging over my darling and her going out into that awful place
my only comfort is that we are in the hands of god
only for that faith it would be easier to die than to live and so be quit of all the trouble
mr morris and dr seward were off on their long ride before we started they are to keep up the right bank far enough off to get on higher lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following of its curves
they have for the first stages two men to ride and lead their spare horsesfour in all so as not to excite curiosity
when they dismiss the men which shall be shortly they shall themselves look after the horses
it may be necessary for us to join forces if so they can mount our whole party
one of the saddles has a movable horn and can be easily adapted for mina if required
it is a wild adventure we are on
here as we are rushing along through the darkness with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike us with all the mysterious voices of the night around us it all comes home
we seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways into a whole world of dark and dreadful things
godalming is shutting the furnace door
31 october
still hurrying along
the day has come and godalming is sleeping
i am on watch
the morning is bitterly cold the furnace heat is grateful though we have heavy fur coats
as yet we have passed only a few open boats but none of them had on board any box or package of anything like the size of the one we seek
the men were scared every time we turned our electric lamp on them and fell on their knees and prayed
1 november evening
no news all day we have found nothing of the kind we seek
we have now passed into the bistritza and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone
we have overhauled every boat big and little
early this morning one crew took us for a government boat and treated us accordingly
we saw in this a way of smoothing matters so at fundu where the bistritza runs into the sereth we got a roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously
with every boat which we have overhauled since then this trick has succeeded we have had every deference shown to us and not once any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do
some of the slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board
this was before they came to fundu so they could not tell us whether the boat turned into the bistritza or continued on up the sereth
at fundu we could not hear of any such boat so she must have passed there in the night
i am feeling very sleepy the cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me and nature must have rest some time
godalming insists that he shall keep the first watch
god bless him for all his goodness to poor dear mina and me
2 november morning
it is broad daylight
that good fellow would not wake me
he says it would have been a sin to for i slept peacefully and was forgetting my trouble
it seems brutally selfish to me to have slept so long and let him watch all night but he was quite right
i am a new man this morning and as i sit here and watch him sleeping i can do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine steering and keeping watch
i can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to me
i wonder where mina is now and van helsing
they should have got to veresti about noon on wednesday
it would take them some time to get the carriage and horses so if they had started and travelled hard they would be about now at the borgo pass
god guide and help them
i am afraid to think what may happen
if we could only go faster
but we cannot the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost
i wonder how dr seward and mr morris are getting on
there seem to be endless streams running down the mountains into this river but as none of them are very largeat present at all events though they are terrible doubtless in winter and when the snow meltsthe horsemen may not have met much obstruction
i hope that before we get to strasba we may see them for if by that time we have not overtaken the count it may be necessary to take counsel together what to do next
2 november
three days on the road
no news and no time to write it if there had been for every moment is precious
we have had only the rest needful for the horses but we are both bearing it wonderfully
those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful
we must push on we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again
3 november
we heard at fundu that the launch had gone up the bistritza
i wish it wasnt so cold
there are signs of snow coming and if it falls heavy it will stop us
in such case we must get a sledge and go on russian fashion
4 november
today we heard of the launch having been detained by an accident when trying to force a way up the rapids
the slovak boats get up all right by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge
some went up only a few hours before
godalming is an amateur fitter himself and evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again
finally they got up the rapids all right with local help and are off on the chase afresh
i fear that the boat is not any better for the accident the peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again she kept stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight
we must push on harder than ever our help may be wanted soon
arrived at veresti at noon
the professor tells me that this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all and that all i could say was dark and quiet
he is off now buying a carriage and horses
he says that he will later on try to buy additional horses so that we may be able to change them on the way
we have something more than 70 miles before us
the country is lovely and most interesting if only we were under different conditions how delightful it would be to see it all
if jonathan and i were driving through it alone what a pleasure it would be
to stop and see people and learn something of their life and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and picturesqueness of the whole wild beautiful country and the quaint people
dr van helsing has returned
he has got the carriage and horses we are to have some dinner and to start in an hour
the landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions it seems enough for a company of soldiers
the professor encourages her and whispers to me that it may be a week before we can get any good food again
he has been shopping too and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats and wraps and all sorts of warm things
there will not be any chance of our being cold
we shall soon be off
i am afraid to think what may happen to us
we are truly in the hands of god
he alone knows what may be and i pray him with all the strength of my sad and humble soul that he will watch over my beloved husband that whatever may happen jonathan may know that i loved him and honoured him more than i can say and that my latest and truest thought will be always for him
all day long we have travelled and at a good speed
the horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated for they go willingly their full stage at best speed
we have now had so many changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one
dr van helsing is laconic he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to bistritz and pays them well to make the exchange of horses
we get hot soup or coffee or tea and off we go
it is a lovely country full of beauties of all imaginable kinds and the people are brave and strong and simple and seem full of nice qualities
they are very very superstitious
in the first house where we stopped when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me to keep off the evil eye
i believe they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our food and i cant abide garlic
ever since then i have taken care not to take off my hat or veil and so have escaped their suspicions
we are travelling fast and as we have no driver with us to carry tales we go ahead of scandal but i daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way
the professor seems tireless all day he would not take any rest though he made me sleep for a long spell
at sunset time he hypnotised me and he says that i answered as usual darkness lapping water and creaking wood so our enemy is still on the river
i am afraid to think of jonathan but somehow i have now no fear for him or for myself
i write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready
dr van helsing is sleeping poor dear he looks very tired and old and grey but his mouth is set as firmly as a conquerors even in his sleep he is instinct with resolution
when we have well started i must make him rest whilst i drive
i shall tell him that we have days before us and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be needed
all is ready we are off shortly
i was successful and we took turns driving all night now the day is on us bright though cold
there is a strange heaviness in the airi say heaviness for want of a better word i mean that it oppresses us both
it is very cold and only our warm furs keep us comfortable
at dawn van helsing hypnotised me he says i answered darkness creaking wood and roaring water so the river is changing as they ascend
i do hope that my darling will not run any chance of dangermore than need be but we are in gods hands
2 november night
all day long driving
the country gets wilder as we go and the great spurs of the carpathians which at veresti seemed so far from us and so low on the horizon now seem to gather round us and tower in front
we both seem in good spirits i think we make an effort each to cheer the other in the doing so we cheer ourselves
dr van helsing says that by morning we shall reach the borgo pass
the houses are very few here now and the professor says that the last horse we got will have to go on with us as we may not be able to change
he got two in addition to the two we changed so that now we have a rude fourinhand
the dear horses are patient and good and they give us no trouble
we are not worried with other travellers and so even i can drive
we shall get to the pass in daylight we do not want to arrive before
so we take it easy and have each a long rest in turn
oh what will tomorrow bring to us
we go to seek the place where my poor darling suffered so much
god grant that we may be guided aright and that he will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both and who are in such deadly peril
as for me i am not worthy in his sight
i am unclean to his eyes and shall be until he may deign to let me stand forth in his sight as one of those who have not incurred his wrath
memorandum by abraham van helsing
this to my old and true friend john seward m
of purfleet london in case i may not see him
it may explain
it is morning and i write by a fire which all the night i have kept alivemadam mina aiding me
it is cold cold so cold that the grey heavy sky is full of snow which when it falls will settle for all winter as the ground is hardening to receive it
it seems to have affected madam mina she has been so heavy of head all day that she was not like herself
she sleeps and sleeps and sleeps
she who is usual so alert have done literally nothing all the day she even have lost her appetite
she make no entry into her little diary she who write so faithful at every pause
something whisper to me that all is not well
however tonight she is more vif
her long sleep all day have refresh and restore her for now she is all sweet and bright as ever
at sunset i try to hypnotise her but alas
with no effect the power has grown less and less with each day and tonight it fail me altogether
well gods will be donewhatever it may be and whithersoever it may lead
now to the historical for as madam mina write not in her stenography i must in my cumbrous old fashion that so each day of us may not go unrecorded
we got to the borgo pass just after sunrise yesterday morning
when i saw the signs of the dawn i got ready for the hypnotism
we stopped our carriage and got down so that there might be no disturbance
i made a couch with furs and madam mina lying down yield herself as usual but more slow and more short time than ever to the hypnotic sleep
as before came the answer darkness and the swirling of water
then she woke bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the pass
at this time and place she become all on fire with zeal some new guiding power be in her manifested for she point to a road and say this is the way
how know you it
i ask
of course i know it she answer and with a pause add have not my jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel
at first i think somewhat strange but soon i see that there be only one such byroad
it is used but little and very different from the coach road from the bukovina to bistritz which is more wide and hard and more of use
so we came down this road when we meet other waysnot always were we sure that they were roads at all for they be neglect and light snow have fallenthe horses know and they only
i give rein to them and they go on so patient
byandby we find all the things which jonathan have note in that wonderful diary of him
then we go on for long long hours and hours
at the first i tell madam mina to sleep she try and she succeed
she sleep all the time till at the last i feel myself to suspicious grow and attempt to wake her
but she sleep on and i may not wake her though i try
i do not wish to try too hard lest i harm her for i know that she have suffer much and sleep at times be allinall to her
i think i drowse myself for all of sudden i feel guilt as though i have done something i find myself bolt up with the reins in my hand and the good horses go along jog jog just as ever
i look down and find madam mina still sleep
it is now not far off sunset time and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep
for we are going up and up and all is oh
so wild and rocky as though it were the end of the world
then i arouse madam mina
this time she wake with not much trouble and then i try to put her to hypnotic sleep
but she sleep not being as though i were not
still i try and try till all at once i find her and myself in dark so i look round and find that the sun have gone down
madam mina laugh and i turn and look at her
she is now quite awake and look so well as i never saw her since that night at carfax when we first enter the counts house
i am amaze and not at ease then but she is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that i forget all fear
i light a fire for we have brought supply of wood with us and she prepare food while i undo the horses and set them tethered in shelter to feed
then when i return to the fire she have my supper ready
i go to help her but she smile and tell me that she have eat alreadythat she was so hungry that she would not wait
i like it not and i have grave doubts but i fear to affright her and so i am silent of it
she help me and i eat alone and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the fire and i tell her to sleep while i watch
but presently i forget all of watching and when i sudden remember that i watch i find her lying quiet but awake and looking at me with so bright eyes
once twice more the same occur and i get much sleep till before morning
when i wake i try to hypnotise her but alas
though she shut her eyes obedient she may not sleep
the sun rise up and up and up and then sleep come to her too late but so heavy that she will not wake
i have to lift her up and place her sleeping in the carriage when i have harnessed the horses and made all ready
madam still sleep and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before
and i like it not
and i am afraid afraid afraid
i am afraid of all thingseven to think but i must go on my way
the stake we play for is life and death or more than these and we must not flinch
5 november morning
let me be accurate in everything for though you and i have seen some strange things together you may at the first think that i van helsing am madthat the many horrors and the so long strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain
all yesterday we travel ever getting closer to the mountains and moving into a more and more wild and desert land
there are great frowning precipices and much falling water and nature seem to have held sometime her carnival
madam mina still sleep and sleep and though i did have hunger and appeased it i could not waken hereven for food
i began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her tainted as she is with that vampire baptism
well said i to myself if it be that she sleep all the day it shall also be that i do not sleep at night
as we travel on the rough road for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there was i held down my head and slept
again i waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed and found madam mina still sleeping and the sun low down
but all was indeed changed the frowning mountains seemed further away and we were near the top of a steeprising hill on summit of which was such a castle as jonathan tell of in his diary
at once i exulted and feared for now for good or ill the end was near
i woke madam mina and again tried to hypnotise her but alas
unavailing till too late
then ere the great dark came upon usfor even after downsun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow and all was for a time in a great twilighti took out the horses and fed them in what shelter i could
then i make a fire and near it i make madam mina now awake and more charming than ever sit comfortable amid her rugs
i got ready food but she would not eat simply saying that she had not hunger
i did not press her knowing her unavailingness
but i myself eat for i must needs now be strong for all
then with the fear on me of what might be i drew a ring so big for her comfort round where madam mina sat and over the ring i passed some of the wafer and i broke it fine so that all was well guarded
she sat still all the timeso still as one dead and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale and no word she said
but when i drew near she clung to me and i could know that the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a tremor that was pain to feel
i said to her presently when she had grown more quiet will you not come over to the fire
for i wished to make a test of what she could
she rose obedient but when she have made a step she stopped and stood as one stricken
why not go on
she shook her head and coming back sat down in her place
then looking at me with open eyes as of one waked from sleep she said simply i cannot
and remained silent
i rejoiced for i knew that what she could not none of those that we dreaded could
though there might be danger to her body yet her soul was safe
presently the horses began to scream and tore at their tethers till i came to them and quieted them
when they did feel my hands on them they whinnied low as in joy and licked at my hands and were quiet for a time
many times through the night did i come to them till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest and every time my coming was with quiet of them
in the cold hour the fire began to die and i was about stepping forth to replenish it for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist
even in the dark there was a light of some kind as there ever is over snow and it seemed as though the snowflurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments
all was in dead grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered as if in terror of the worst
i began to fearhorrible fears but then came to me the sense of safety in that ring wherein i stood
i began too to think that my imaginings were of the night and the gloom and the unrest that i have gone through and all the terrible anxiety
it was as though my memories of all jonathans horrid experience were befooling me for the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round till i could get as though a shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him
and then the horses cowered lower and lower and moaned in terror as men do in pain
even the madness of fright was not to them so that they could break away
i feared for my dear madam mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round
i looked at her but she sat calm and smiled at me when i would have stepped to the fire to replenish it she caught me and held me back and whispered like a voice that one hears in a dream so low it was no
do not go without
here you are safe
i turned to her and looking in her eyes said but you
it is for you that i fear
whereat she laugheda laugh low and unreal and said fear for me
why fear for me
none safer in all the world from them than i am and as i wondered at the meaning of her words a puff of wind made the flame leap up and i see the red scar on her forehead
then alas
i knew
did i not i would soon have learned for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer but keeping ever without the holy circle
then they began to materialise tillif god have not take away my reason for i saw it through my eyesthere were before me in actual flesh the same three women that jonathan saw in the room when they would have kissed his throat
i knew the swaying round forms the bright hard eyes the white teeth the ruddy colour the voluptuous lips
they smiled ever at poor dear madam mina and as their laugh came through the silence of the night they twined their arms and pointed to her and said in those so sweet tingling tones that jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the waterglasses come sister
come to us
in fear i turned to my poor madam mina and my heart with gladness leapt like flame for oh
the terror in her sweet eyes the repulsion the horror told a story to my heart that was all of hope
god be thanked she was not yet of them
i seized some of the firewood which was by me and holding out some of the wafer advanced on them towards the fire
they drew back before me and laughed their low horrid laugh
i fed the fire and feared them not for i knew that we were safe within our protections
they could not approach me whilst so armed nor madam mina whilst she remained within the ring which she could not leave no more than they could enter
the horses had ceased to moan and lay still on the ground the snow fell on them softly and they grew whiter
i knew that there was for the poor beasts no more of terror
and so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the snowgloom
i was desolate and afraid and full of woe and terror but when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again
at the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist and snow the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away towards the castle and were lost
instinctively with the dawn coming i turned to madam mina intending to hypnotise her but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep from which i could not wake her
i tried to hypnotise through her sleep but she made no response none at all and the day broke
i fear yet to stir
i have made my fire and have seen the horses they are all dead
today i have much to do here and i keep waiting till the sun is up high for there may be places where i must go where that sunlight though snow and mist obscure it will be to me a safety
i will strengthen me with breakfast and then i will to my terrible work
madam mina still sleeps and god be thanked
she is calm in her sleep
4 november evening
the accident to the launch has been a terrible thing for us
only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago and by now my dear mina would have been free
i fear to think of her off on the wolds near that horrid place
we have got horses and we follow on the track
i note this whilst godalming is getting ready
we have our arms
the szgany must look out if they mean fight
oh if only morris and seward were with us
we must only hope
if i write no more goodbye mina
god bless and keep you
5 november
with the dawn we saw the body of szgany before us dashing away from the river with their leiterwagon
they surrounded it in a cluster and hurried along as though beset
the snow is falling lightly and there is a strange excitement in the air
it may be our own feelings but the depression is strange
far off i hear the howling of wolves the snow brings them down from the mountains and there are dangers to all of us and from all sides
the horses are nearly ready and we are soon off
we ride to death of some one
god alone knows who or where or what or when or how it may be
5 november afternoon
i am at least sane
thank god for that mercy at all events though the proving it has been dreadful
when i left madam mina sleeping within the holy circle i took my way to the castle
the blacksmith hammer which i took in the carriage from veresti was useful though the doors were all open i broke them off the rusty hinges lest some illintent or illchance should close them so that being entered i might not get out
jonathans bitter experience served me here
by memory of his diary i found my way to the old chapel for i knew that here my work lay
the air was oppressive it seemed as if there was some sulphurous fume which at times made me dizzy
either there was a roaring in my ears or i heard afar off the howl of wolves
then i bethought me of my dear madam mina and i was in terrible plight
the dilemma had me between his horns
her i had not dare to take into this place but left safe from the vampire in that holy circle and yet even there would be the wolf
i resolve me that my work lay here and that as to the wolves we must submit if it were gods will
at any rate it was only death and freedom beyond
so did i choose for her
had it but been for myself the choice had been easy the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than the grave of the vampire
so i make my choice to go on with my work
i knew that there were at least three graves to findgraves that are inhabit so i search and search and i find one of them
she lay in her vampire sleep so full of life and voluptuous beauty that i shudder as though i have come to do murder
ah i doubt not that in old time when such things were many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine found at the last his heart fail him and then his nerve
so he delay and delay and delay till the mere beauty and the fascination of the wanton undead have hypnotise him and he remain on and on till sunset come and the vampire sleep be over
then the beautiful eyes of the fair woman open and look love and the voluptuous mouth present to a kissand man is weak
and there remain one more victim in the vampire fold one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the undead
there is some fascination surely when i am moved by the mere presence of such an one even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and heavy with the dust of centuries though there be that horrid odour such as the lairs of the count have had
yes i was movedi van helsing with all my purpose and with my motive for hatei was moved to a yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my very soul
it may have been that the need of natural sleep and the strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me
certain it was that i was lapsing into sleep the openeyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet fascination when there came through the snowstilled air a long low wail so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound of a clarion
for it was the voice of my dear madam mina that i heard
then i braced myself again to my horrid task and found by wrenching away tombtops one other of the sisters the other dark one
i dared not pause to look on her as i had on her sister lest once more i should begin to be enthrall but i go on searching until presently i find in a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister which like jonathan i had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of the mist
she was so fair to look on so radiantly beautiful so exquisitely voluptuous that the very instinct of man in me which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers made my head whirl with new emotion
but god be thanked that soulwail of my dear madam mina had not died out of my ears and before the spell could be wrought further upon me i had nerved myself to my wild work
by this time i had searched all the tombs in the chapel so far as i could tell and as there had been only three of these undead phantoms around us in the night i took it that there were no more of active undead existent
there was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest huge it was and nobly proportioned
on it was but one word dracula
this then was the undead home of the kingvampire to whom so many more were due
its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what i knew
before i began to restore these women to their dead selves through my awful work i laid in draculas tomb some of the wafer and so banished him from it undead for ever
then began my terrible task and i dreaded it
had it been but one it had been easy comparative
but three
to begin twice more after i had been through a deed of horror for if it was terrible with the sweet miss lucy what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived through centuries and who had been strengthened by the passing of the years who would if they could have fought for their foul lives
oh my friend john but it was butcher work had i not been nerved by thoughts of other dead and of the living over whom hung such a pall of fear i could not have gone on
i tremble and tremble even yet though till all was over god be thanked my nerve did stand
had i not seen the repose in the first place and the gladness that stole over it just ere the final dissolution came as realisation that the soul had been won i could not have gone further with my butchery
i could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home the plunging of writhing form and lips of bloody foam
i should have fled in terror and left my work undone
but it is over
and the poor souls i can pity them now and weep as i think of them placid each in her full sleep of death for a short moment ere fading
for friend john hardly had my knife severed the head of each before the whole body began to melt away and crumble in to its native dust as though the death that should have come centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud i am here
before i left the castle i so fixed its entrances that never more can the count enter there undead
when i stepped into the circle where madam mina slept she woke from her sleep and seeing me cried out in pain that i had endured too much
she said come away from this awful place
let us go to meet my husband who is i know coming towards us
she was looking thin and pale and weak but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour
i was glad to see her paleness and her illness for my mind was full of the fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep
and so with trust and hope and yet full of fear we go eastward to meet our friendsand him whom madam mina tell me that she know are coming to meet us
6 november
it was late in the afternoon when the professor and i took our way towards the east whence i knew jonathan was coming
we did not go fast though the way was steeply downhill for we had to take heavy rugs and wraps with us we dared not face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow
we had to take some of our provisions too for we were in a perfect desolation and so far as we could see through the snowfall there was not even the sign of habitation
when we had gone about a mile i was tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest
then we looked back and saw where the clear line of draculas castle cut the sky for we were so deep under the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the carpathian mountains was far below it
we saw it in all its grandeur perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice and with seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side
there was something wild and uncanny about the place
we could hear the distant howling of wolves
they were far off but the sound even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall was full of terror
i knew from the way dr van helsing was searching about that he was trying to seek some strategic point where we would be less exposed in case of attack
the rough roadway still led downwards we could trace it through the drifted snow
in a little while the professor signalled to me so i got up and joined him
he had found a wonderful spot a sort of natural hollow in a rock with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders
he took me by the hand and drew me in see
he said here you will be in shelter and if the wolves do come i can meet them one by one
he brought in our furs and made a snug nest for me and got out some provisions and forced them upon me
but i could not eat to even try to do so was repulsive to me and much as i would have liked to please him i could not bring myself to the attempt
he looked very sad but did not reproach me
taking his fieldglasses from the case he stood on the top of the rock and began to search the horizon
suddenly he called out look
madam mina look
i sprang up and stood beside him on the rock he handed me his glasses and pointed
the snow was now falling more heavily and swirled about fiercely for a high wind was beginning to blow
however there were times when there were pauses between the snow flurries and i could see a long way round
from the height where we were it was possible to see a great distance and far off beyond the white waste of snow i could see the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way
straight in front of us and not far offin fact so near that i wondered we had not noticed beforecame a group of mounted men hurrying along
in the midst of them was a cart a long leiterwagon which swept from side to side like a dogs tail wagging with each stern inequality of the road
outlined against the snow as they were i could see from the mens clothes that they were peasants or gypsies of some kind
on the cart was a great square chest
my heart leaped as i saw it for i felt that the end was coming
the evening was now drawing close and well i knew that at sunset the thing which was till then imprisoned there would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all pursuit
in fear i turned to the professor to my consternation however he was not there
an instant later i saw him below me
round the rock he had drawn a circle such as we had found shelter in last night
when he had completed it he stood beside me again saying at least you shall be safe here from him
he took the glasses from me and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us
see he said they come quickly they are flogging the horses and galloping as hard as they can
he paused and went on in a hollow voice they are racing for the sunset
we may be too late
down came another blinding rush of driving snow and the whole landscape was blotted out
it soon passed however and once more his glasses were fixed on the plain
then came a sudden cry look
see two horsemen follow fast coming up from the south
it must be quincey and john
take the glass
look before the snow blots it all out
i took it and looked
the two men might be dr seward and mr morris
i knew at all events that neither of them was jonathan
at the same time i knew that jonathan was not far off looking around i saw on the north side of the coming party two other men riding at breakneck speed
one of them i knew was jonathan and the other i took of course to be lord godalming
they too were pursuing the party with the cart
when i told the professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy and after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible he laid his winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter
they are all converging he said
when the time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides
i got out my revolver ready to hand for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer
when the snow storm abated a moment we looked again
it was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us and beyond the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the far mountain tops
sweeping the glass all around us i could see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbersthe wolves were gathering for their prey
every instant seemed an age whilst we waited
the wind came now in fierce bursts and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in circling eddies
at times we could not see an arms length before us but at others as the hollowsounding wind swept by us it seemed to clear the airspace around us so that we could see afar off
we had of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset that we knew with fair accuracy when it would be and we knew that before long the sun would set
it was hard to believe that by our watches it was less than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to converge close upon us
the wind came now with fiercer and more bitter sweeps and more steadily from the north
it seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us for with only occasional bursts the snow fell
we could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party the pursued and the pursuers
strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realise or at least to care that they were pursued they seemed however to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the mountain tops
closer and closer they drew
the professor and i crouched down behind our rock and held our weapons ready i could see that he was determined that they should not pass
one and all were quite unaware of our presence
all at once two voices shouted out to halt
one was my jonathans raised in a high key of passion the other mr morris strong resolute tone of quiet command
the gypsies may not have known the language but there was no mistaking the tone in whatever tongue the words were spoken
instinctively they reined in and at the instant lord godalming and jonathan dashed up at one side and dr seward and mr morris on the other
the leader of the gypsies a splendidlooking fellow who sat his horse like a centaur waved them back and in a fierce voice gave to his companions some word to proceed
they lashed the horses which sprang forward but the four men raised their winchester rifles and in an unmistakable way commanded them to stop
at the same moment dr van helsing and i rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them
seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew up
the leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon he carried knife or pistol and held himself in readiness to attack
issue was joined in an instant
the leader with a quick movement of his rein threw his horse out in front and pointing first to the sunnow close down on the hill topsand then to the castle said something which i did not understand
for answer all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards the cart
i should have felt terrible fear at seeing jonathan in such danger but that the ardour of battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them i felt no fear but only a wild surging desire to do something
seeing the quick movement of our parties the leader of the gypsies gave a command his men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order
in the midst of this i could see that jonathan on one side of the ring of men and quincey on the other were forcing a way to the cart it was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set
nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them
neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front nor the howling of the wolves behind appeared to even attract their attention
jonathans impetuosity and the manifest singleness of his purpose seemed to overawe those in front of him instinctively they cowered aside and let him pass
in an instant he had jumped upon the cart and with a strength which seemed incredible raised the great box and flung it over the wheel to the ground
in the meantime mr morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of szgany
all the time i had been breathlessly watching jonathan i had with the tail of my eye seen him pressing desperately forward and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them and they cut at him
he had parried with his great bowie knife and at first i thought that he too had come through in safety but as he sprang beside jonathan who had by now jumped from the cart i could see that with his left hand he was clutching at his side and that the blood was spurting through his fingers
he did not delay notwithstanding this for as jonathan with desperate energy attacked one end of the chest attempting to prize off the lid with his great kukri knife he attacked the other frantically with his bowie
under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield the nails drew with a quick screeching sound and the top of the box was thrown back
by this time the gypsies seeing themselves covered by the winchesters and at the mercy of lord godalming and dr seward had given in and made no resistance
the sun was almost down on the mountain tops and the shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow
i saw the count lying within the box upon the earth some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him
he was deathly pale just like a waxen image and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which i knew too well
as i looked the eyes saw the sinking sun and the look of hate in them turned to triumph
but on the instant came the sweep and flash of jonathans great knife
i shrieked as i saw it shear through the throat whilst at the same moment mr morriss bowie knife plunged into the heart
it was like a miracle but before our very eyes and almost in the drawing of a breath the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight
i shall be glad as long as i live that even in that moment of final dissolution there was in the face a look of peace such as i never could have imagined might have rested there
the castle of dracula now stood out against the red sky and every stone of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the setting sun
the gypsies taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary disappearance of the dead man turned without a word and rode away as if for their lives
those who were unmounted jumped upon the leiterwagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them
the wolves which had withdrawn to a safe distance followed in their wake leaving us alone
mr morris who had sunk to the ground leaned on his elbow holding his hand pressed to his side the blood still gushed through his fingers
i flew to him for the holy circle did not now keep me back so did the two doctors
jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his head on his shoulder
with a sigh he took with a feeble effort my hand in that of his own which was unstained
he must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face for he smiled at me and said i am only too happy to have been of any service
oh god
he cried suddenly struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me it was worth for this to die
the sun was now right down upon the mountain top and the red gleams fell upon my face so that it was bathed in rosy light
with one impulse the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest amen broke from all as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger
the dying man spoke now god be thanked that all has not been in vain
the snow is not more stainless than her forehead
the curse has passed away
and to our bitter grief with a smile and in silence he died a gallant gentleman
seven years ago we all went through the flames and the happiness of some of us since then is we think well worth the pain we endured
it is an added joy to mina and to me that our boys birthday is the same day as that on which quincey morris died
his mother holds i know the secret belief that some of our brave friends spirit has passed into him
his bundle of names links all our little band of men together but we call him quincey
in the summer of this year we made a journey to transylvania and went over the old ground which was and is to us so full of vivid and terrible memories
it was almost impossible to believe that the things which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were living truths
every trace of all that had been was blotted out
the castle stood as before reared high above a waste of desolation
when we got home we were talking of the old timewhich we could all look back on without despair for godalming and seward are both happily married
i took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since our return so long ago
we were struck with the fact that in all the mass of material of which the record is composed there is hardly one authentic document nothing but a mass of typewriting except the later notebooks of mina and seward and myself and van helsings memorandum
we could hardly ask any one even did we wish to to accept these as proofs of so wild a story
van helsing summed it all up as he said with our boy on his knee we want no proofs we ask none to believe us
this boy will some day know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is
already he knows her sweetness and loving care later on he will understand how some men so loved her that they did dare much for her sake
